   # OR:
       prepare-refseqs.pl --fasta <file1> --fasta <file2>  [options]
   # OR:
       prepare-refseqs.pl --indexed_fasta <file1>  [options]
   # OR:
       prepare-refseqs.pl --conf <JBrowse config file>  [options]
   # OR:
       prepare-refseqs.pl --sizes <sizes file>  [options]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Formats reference sequence data for use with JBrowse.

This tool can also read fasta files compressed with gzip, if they end
in .gz or .gzip.

You can use a GFF file to describe the reference sequences; or you can
use a JBrowse config file (pointing to a BioPerl database) or a FASTA
file, together with a list of refseq names or a list of refseq IDs.
If you use a GFF file, it should contain ##sequence-region lines as
described in the GFF specs, and/or it should be GFF version 3 with an
embedded FASTA section.

If you use a JBrowse config file or FASTA file, you can either provide
a (comma-separated) list of refseq names, or (if the names aren't
globally unique) a list of refseq IDs; or (for FASTA files only) you
can omit the list of refseqs, in which case every sequence in the
database will be used.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item --gff <file>

Get reference sequences from a GFF3 file with embedded sequence
information.

=item --fasta <file>

A FASTA file, optionally gzipped from which to load reference
sequences.

=item --indexed_fasta <file>

A FASTA file (which should already have an accompaning '.fai' file)
from which to load reference sequences.

=item --conf <file>

biodb-to-json.pl configuration file that defines a database from which
to get reference sequence information.

=item --out <output directory>

Optional directory to write to.  Defaults to data/.

=item --noseq

Do not store the actual sequence bases, just the sequence metadata
(name, length, and so forth).

=item --refs <comma-separated list of refseq names>

Output only the sequences with the given names.

=item --compress

If passed, compress the reference sequences with gzip, making the
chunks be .txt.gz.  NOTE: this requires a bit of additional web server
configuration to be served correctly.

=item --chunksize <num>

Size of sequence chunks to make, in base pairs.  Default 20kb.  This
is multiplied by 4 if --compress is passed, so that the compressed
sequence files are still approximately this size.

=item --nohash

Store sequences in a flat seq/$seqname/$chunk.txt structure, instead
of the new (more scalable) /seq/hash/hash/hash/$seqname-$chunk.txt
structure.

=item --trackLabel <label>

The unique name of the sequence track, default 'DNA'.

=item --key <string>

The displayed name of the sequence track, defaults to 'Reference sequence'.

=item --seqType <string>

The Name of the alphabet used for these reference sequences, usually
either 'dna', 'rna', or 'protein'.
