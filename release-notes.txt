## Minor improvements

 * Added options to Alignments, Alignments2, and SNPCoverage tracks to
   allow hiding reads that are duplicates, fail vendor QC, have
   missing mate pairs, are secondary alignments, and/or are
   supplementary alignments.  Thanks to Kieran Raine and Andrew Uzilov
   for pointing out the need for this, and for their input on its
   design (issue #332).

 * Added support for a `variables` configuration for SPARQL data
   stores that can be used to specify additional variables for
   interpolating into a SPARQL query.  Thanks to Toshiaki Katayama for
   suggesting this.

 * Added the ability for Sequence tracks to display a 6- or 3-frame
   translation of the reference sequence.  Thanks to Daniel Kasenberg
   for implementing this (issue #221).

 * Added checkboxes in the track menu of Sequence tracks that allow
   users to toggle the display of the forward strand, reverse strand,
   and 6-frame translation.

 * Added support for an `addStores` variable in the query string of the
   URL used to start JBrowse.  This variable accepts store
   configurations (which are a way to specify data sources separately
   from track configurations, so multiple tracks can use the same data
   source) in JSON format.  For example, to add a store called
   "urlbam" that points to a BAM file, you could use the JSON:

       `{ "urlbam": { "type": "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/BAM", "urlTemplate": "/path/to/my/bamfile.bam" }}`

   which, when URI-escaped and put in the query string, looks like:

       `addStores=%7B%20%22urlbam%22%3A%20%7B%20%22type%22%3A%20%22JBrowse%2FStore%2FSeqFeature%2FBAM%22%2C%20%22urlTemplate%22%3A%20%22%2Fpath%2Fto%2Fmy%2Fbamfile.bam%22%20%7D%7D`

 * Slightly improved performance of generate-names.pl in cases where
   --completionLimit is zero.  Also improved the POD documentation of
   the --completionLimit parameter for generate-names.pl. Thanks to
   Richard Hayes for his continued patience.

## Bug fixes

 * Fixed some bugs that prevented proper display of BigWig files
   larger than 4GB. Thanks to Keiran Raine for pointing this out.

 * Fixed a major performance bug that unnecessarily slowed down
   display of large BigWig files with Wiggle tracks when `autoscale`
   is set to "local".

 * Fixed a bug that prevented display of BAM reads that had MD tags
   but no associated CIGAR string.  Thanks to Keiran Raine for point
   this out (issue #330).

 * Fixed a bug in which FixedImage tracks (e.g. legacy image-based
   Wiggle tracks) never take down the "Loading" message when
   displaying on a reference sequence for which no image data has been
   provided.

 * Fixed a bug that prevented rendering of mismatches, insertions, and
   deletions in a BAM read that occurred after a skip. Thanks to Gregg
   Helt for noticing this and fixing it (issue #325).

 * Fixed a bug in which the SNP frequencies calculated by SNPCoverage
   tracks were sometimes incorrect.  Thanks to Matthew Conte for
   pointing this out (issue #335).

 * Fixed a bug in which reference sequences with a start coordinate
   other than zero would cause the overview scale track to not be
   drawn correctly.  Thanks to Gregg Helt for noticing this and
   working on an initial fix (issue #324).

 * Fixed a bug in which the most recent location visited on a given
   reference sequence was not properly being restored from the saved
   cookie.  Thanks to Gregg Helt for the initial fix for this
   (issue #321).

 * Fixed a bug in which event handlers and blocks in CanvasFeatures
   tracks were not being properly cleaned up.  The most prominent
   visible consequences of this were duplicate dialog boxes being
   opened when clicking on a canvas feature.  Thanks to Keiran Raine
   for noticing this and making sure it was fixed (issue #329).

 * Fixed a bug with flatfile-to-json.pl parsing of GenBank locations.
   Thanks to Steve Marshall for pointing this out (issue #323).

# Release 1.10.2     2013-08-15 13:57:16 EST5EDT

 * Added mouse-over 'tooltips' to to CanvasFeatures tracks that show
   the a feature's label and description when the mouse hovers over
   it.  Thanks to Daniel Kasenberg for implementing this.

 * Strand arrowheads in CanvasFeatures tracks now attempt to stay
   visible on the screen, like they do in HTMLFeatures tracks.  Thanks
   to Daniel Kasenberg for implementing this.

 * Fixed bugs and inefficiencies preventing JBrowse from handling very
   dense BigWig files.  Thanks to Michael Axtell for pointing this out
   (issue #312).

 * Fixed a bug in which features were not always laid out correctly in
   CanvasFeature tracks when the display mode is set to "compact".

 * Fixed a bug causing the text labels of mismatching bases in
   Alignments2 tracks (i.e. `Alignments` canvas glyphs) to be slightly
   misaligned vertically when feature labels are turned on (they are
   off by default for Alignments glyphs).

 * Fixed a bug preventing the `defaultTracks` configuration variable
   from operating correctly.

# Release 1.10.1     2013-08-06 15:32:21 EST5EDT

 * Added support in `maker2jbrowse` for user-defined source tags in
   GFF3 output from MAKER.  Thanks to Carson Holt for contributing
   this fix.

 * NCList data stores (actually the array representation used therein)
   now store feature attribute names case-insensitively.

 * Fixed a bug in which features in canvas-based feature tracks could
   not be clicked in Firefox.  Thanks to GitHub user mke21 for
   pointing this out, and to Daniel Kasenberg for fixing my fix to
   work with older versions of Chrome.

 * Fixed a bug with client-side GFF3 parsing in which the strand of
   features was not being correctly parsed.

 * Fixed bug preventing backward-compatibility with 1.2.1-formatted
   data. Thanks to Daniel Kasenberg for implementing this.

 * Fixed a bug in the Gene glyph that caused the browser to crash if a
   gene feature has no subfeatures.


# Release 1.10.0     2013-07-30 14:25:06 EST5EDT

## Major improvements

 * Added powerful combination tracks, which can combine data from
   multiple other tracks using range, arithmetic, or masking
   operations.  For example, a BigWig track can be masked to highlight
   only regions that lie within features from a BAM track.  Or the
   intersection of two or more feature tracks can be calculated.  To
   create a combination track, select "File->Add combination track"
   from the menu bar, and then add tracks to the new combination track
   by dragging them into it.  A huge thanks to OICR co-op students
   Julien Smith-Roberge and Daniel Kasenberg for implementing this
   powerful feature. It's a very significant accomplishment!

 * Added "normal", "compact", and "collapsed" feature layout options
   for canvas-based feature tracks (currently just Alignments2
   tracks).  Thanks to OICR co-op student Daniel Kasenberg for
   implementing this!

 * Greatly improved the `JBrowse/View/Track/CanvasFeatures` track
   type, to the point where it is probably ready for experienced
   JBrowse users to use in earnest. It renders features using a
   modular glyph system that GBrowse users will find very familiar.
   To give it a try, simply change the `type` key in an existing track
   configuration to "JBrowse/View/Track/CanvasFeatures" and add a
   `glyph` key to set which glyph to use.  Glyphs that are currently
   implemented are:

   * Box - draws a box, optionally with an arrow indicating strandedness.
   * Segments - draws a series of boxes connected with a line, for
     features with subparts.
   * ProcessedTranscript - draws CDS and UTR features, with UTRs a
     different color and thinner.
   * Gene - draws a group of aligned ProcessedTranscript glyphs for
     mRNAs that are subfeatures of a top-level gene feature.

   Each of these glyphs have been patterned as near-clones of the
   (very popular) analogous glyphs in GBrowse.

 * Added a SPARQL data backend to allow displaying features directly
   from a SPARQL endpoint.  Many thanks to the NDBC/DBCLS BioHackathon
   2012 and 2013 participants for suggesting this and helping with
   this work! See http://www.biohackathon.org for more on this
   fantastic (and I think very important) series of hackathons.

 * There is a new "Highlight" button next to the "Go" button that lets
   a user quickly and easily highlight a region with the mouse.

 * Added the ability to "pin" some tracks to the top of the display,
   so that they stay at the top of the pane while the rest of the
   tracks are scrolled vertically.  Thanks to the WebApollo project
   for suggesting this.

 * Integrated a `maker2jbrowse` script into the core JBrowse
   distribution.  You can now visualize your MAKER results in JBrowse
   with a single command:
       `bin/maker2jbrowse -d /path/to/your/maker/master_datastore_index.log`
   Thanks to the MAKER team and Yandell lab for providing the initial
   implementation of `maker2jbrowse`.

## Minor improvements

 * Added support for an `addFeatures` variable in the query string of
   the URL used to start JBrowse.  This variable accepts feature data
   in JSON format in the form:

      `[{ "seq_id":"ctgA", "start": 123, "end": 456, "name": "MyBLASTHit"},...}]`

   which, when URI-escaped and put in the query string, looks like:

      `addFeatures=%5B%7B%20%22seq_id%22%3A%22ctgA%22%2C%20%22start%22%3A%20123%2C%20%22end%22%3A%20456%2C%20%22name%22%3A%20%22MyBLASTHit%22%7D%5D`

   Developers integrating JBrowse into larger project may find this
   feature useful for displaying results from other
   non-JavaScript-based applications (such as legacy web BLAST tools)
   in JBrowse.

   Features added to JBrowse in this way are available in a special
   data store named `url`, which can be specified in a track
   configuration by adding `"store":"url"`.

 * Added support for an `addTracks` variable in the query string of
   the URL used to start JBrowse.  This variable accepts track
   configurations in JSON format in the form:

       `[{"label":"mytrack","store":"url","type":"JBrowse/View/Track/HTMLFeatures"},...]`

   which, when URI-escaped and put in the query string, looks like:

       `addTracks=%5B%7B%22label%22%3A%22mytrack%22%2C%22store%22%3A%22url%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22JBrowse%2FView%2FTrack%2FHTMLFeatures%22%7D%5D`

 * Added "Save track data" option to Alignments2 tracks.  This option
   should have been there all along, but somehow slipped through the
   cracks.  Thanks to Valerie Wong for pointing this out at the 2013
   GMOD Summer School!

 * Statistics about a track's features are now shown in its "About
   this track" dialog, if available.

 * Added support for a --reftypes argument to `prepare-refseqs.pl`,
   allowing you to search a database for reference sequences based on
   the type of the reference sequences, e.g. 'chromosome'.  Thanks to
   Gaelen Burke at the 2013 GMOD Summer School for pointing out the
   need for this, and for assistance in testing the new feature.

 * Added a `--gbk` option to `flatfile-to-json.pl` that accepts a
   GenBank-format text file as input for loading annotation data.
   Thanks to Justin Reese for the initial implementation of this.

 * When formatting features with `flatfile-to-json.pl`, multi-valued
   feature attributes are now only flattened (renamed foo, foo2, foo3,
   etc) for "name", "id", "start", "end", "score", "strand",
   "description", and "note" attributes.  Formerly, all attributes
   were flattened.  This improves the default display of features that
   have many values for some attributes, such as Dbxrefs or GO terms.

 * Further improved scrolling smoothness of HTML-based feature tracks.

 * Added a `JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/FromConfig` feature store adapter
   that can display feature data that is specified directly in
   configuration.  This is mostly used to implement the support for
   `addFeatures` in the JBrowse URL, but some administrators and
   developers may find it conventient as well to define feature data
   directly in the JBrowse configuration.

 * `flatfile-to-json.pl` now supports a `--trackType` option that can
   be used to set the JavaScript track class that will be used for the
   formatted data (e.g. "JBrowse/View/Track/CanvasFeatures" to use the
   new, improved HTML5 canvas-based feature tracks).

 * `biodb-to-json.pl` configuration files now support a `trackType`
   configuration key in each track configuration that can be used to
   set the JavaScript track class that will be used for the formatted
   data (e.g. "JBrowse/View/Track/CanvasFeatures" to use the new,
   improved HTML5 canvas-based feature tracks).

 * `prepare-refseqs.pl` can now format reference sequences from a
   common .sizes (aka .len) file that is just a two-column
   tab-separated list of reference sequence names and their lengths,
   run like:
       bin/prepare-refseqs.pl --sizes myrefs.sizes

 * `prepare-refseqs.pl` can now format reference sequences from a
   gzipped GFF3 if the file's name ends with the suffix ".gz".

 * Added a '--noSubfeatures' option for flatfile-to-json.pl to skip
   importing subfeatures (since `--getSubfeatures` is on by default
   for some time).

 * The `style.label` configuration variable in HTMLFeatures (and
   CanvasFeatures) tracks can now accept a comma-separated string of
   field names in addition to a function callback.  Defaults to
   'name,id';

 * The "Save track data" (data exporting) menu now has "Highlighted
   region" as one of the choices of which range to export, if there is
   a region currently highlighted.

 * The "JBrowse" link on the left side of the menu bar, and the
   browser title, now display the "About this browser" title instead
   of JBrowse, if `aboutThisBrowser` is set in the configuration.
   Thanks to Joanna Kelley at the 2013 GMOD Summer School for
   suggesting this.

 * Tweaked styling of inactive track handles in the default Simple
   track selector to make them look less like pressable buttons.
   Thanks to Pedro Pagan at the 2013 GMOD Summer School for pointing
   out the need for this, and helping to brainstorm how the new styles
   should look.

 * Horizontal mouse-wheel (or trackpad) events can now scroll the
   genome view horizontally.  Thanks to Mara Kim for help testing this
   at the 2013 GMOD Summer School.

 * The "content" of configurable information popups (such as can be
   shown when clicking on features) can now accept a dojo/Deferred or
   other promise object that will provide the content to be shown
   asynchronously.

 * Added a `track.maxFeatureSizeForUnderlyingRefSeq` configuration
   variable, defaulting to 250 Kbp, that sets the maximum length of a
   feature for which the default feature detail popup will attempt to
   display the underlying reference sequence.  Thanks to Colin
   Davenport for pointing out the need for this (issue #291).

 * Added the ability to specify the file name when exporting track
   data to a file.  Thanks to Daniel Kasenberg for implementing this.

 * Added a `track.noExportFiles` configuration variable that, if set
   to true, disables exporting files from the "Save" menu of tracks.

## Bug fixes

 * Fixed a bug that prevented clicking on features in Alignments2 (and
   other canvas feature tracks) in Internet Explorer.

 * Fixed a bad design decision with respect to track metadata stores.
   Before, a given metadata key ("Category", "Conditions", etc) was
   allowed to only be present in one source of track metadata (CSV
   file, configuration file, etc).  The original thinking behind this
   was that it would be better for people to be forced to keep each
   kind of metadata in only one place.  This was silly thinking.
   Thanks to the 2013 GMOD Summer School participants for helping me
   to see the error of my ways.

 * Fixed a bug in which turning off the HTMLFeatures track's "Show
   Labels" did not remove labels for features with descriptions.

 * Fixed a bug with `prepare-refseqs.pl` in which, when multiple
   definitions of a reference sequence are found (as in a GFF3 file
   with both ##sequence-region directives and a FASTA section), the
   seqChunkSize value is not recorded in refSeqs.json and the sequence
   bases cannot be displayed in the "Reference sequence" track.

 * Fixed a synchronization bug in NCList-based feature data stores
   that causes some features to be missing when displaying with a
   CanvasFeatures track.  This bug may also have affected 'Save track
   data' (data export) in some situations.

 * Fixed a bug with GFF3 export in which the phase(!) column was
   missing.  Thanks to Michael Campbell at the 2013 GMOD Summer School
   for helping track this down!

 * Fixed another bug with GFF3 export in which an extra comma would
   sometimes be added at the beginning of GFF3 lines for some child
   features.

 * Fixed a bug in which the global highlighted region was not correctly drawn
   when switching reference sequences.

 * Fixed a minor bug in which the REST store backend did not coerce
   start, end, strand, and score to be numeric if the input JSON had
   them as strings.

# Release 1.9.8     2013-07-05 09:22:36 EST5EDT

 * Removed "XX has no data for this chromosome" popup warning message.
   It was just annoying and not very useful.

 * Added an optional "yScalePosition" element to track configs that
   allows configs with Y axes to have those axes positioned on the
   left or right side of the view, as well as in the center.  Thanks
   to Alexis Grimaldi for making this change.

 * Fixed a bug in which NCList-based tracks display with an error for
   reference sequences on which they have no data.  Thanks to Michael
   Axtell for pointing this out.

 * Improved GFF3 handling in the File->Open tool, fixed a bug in the
   GFF3 parser in which an empty (.) source column caused the GFF3
   parser to crash.

 * Improved scrolling speed when many HTML feature tracks are active.

 * Fixed a bug in which the browser can fail to start for a reference
   sequence that has never been seen before.

 * Fixed a confusing behavior in JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/REST in
   which the URLs it constructs to fetch from did not always have a
   '/' where one would expect.  Thanks to Alex Kalderimis for pointing
   this out.

# Release 1.9.7     2013-06-25 15:41:22 Asia/Tokyo

 * Fixed a bug in which the initial viewing location (passed from a
   URL parameter or similar) is not always set correctly in all parts
   of the browser.  Thanks to Steffi Geisen for pointing this out.

 * Fixed a bug in which JavaScript paths for plugins were incorrectly
   calculated when a `baseUrl` global configuration variable was set.
   Thanks to Matt Bomhoff for pointing this out.

 * Fixed a bug in which XYPlot tracks sometimes failed to draw bars
   for data that was both below the graph origin and below the track's
   configured minimum value.  Thanks to GitHub user drusch for
   pointing this out.

# Release 1.9.6     2013-06-18 14:57:26 EST5EDT

 * Fixed a bug in which the reference sequence selection dropdown menu
   did not work for purely numeric reference sequence names.  Thanks
   to Matt Bomhoff for pointing this out.

 * Fixed a bug with some types of BAM files in which not all BAM
   features would be displayed.  Thanks to Ignazio Carbone for
   pointing this out. (issue #276).

 * Fixed bug in which File->Open failed to open GFF3 files with
   embedded sequences in a FASTA section.

 * Added a `--workdir` option to `generate-names.pl` to allow name
   index building on a faster filesystem than the one that will
   ultimately store the name index.  Thanks to Alexie Papanicolaou for
   suggesting this. (issue #273).

# Release 1.9.5     2013-06-12 12:35:53 EST5EDT

 * Added an `trackSelector.initialSortColumn` configuration variable
   to the faceted track selector that can be used to set the initial
   sort order for the grid in the faceted track selector. Thanks to
   Alexie Papanicolaou for suggesting this.

 * Made Wiggle density tracks indicate out-of-range values using
   separate clip markers at the top and bottom of the color field,
   rather than showing the out-of-range region as a third color (or
   black or white).  Thanks to Gregg Helt for suggesting this.

 * Added support for a `quickHelp` configuration variable that lets
   administrators customize the contents of the Help->General dialog.
   Thanks to Gregg Helt for suggesting this.

 * Rewrote GFF3 direct-access backend to make it more
   standards-compliant and capable of parsing all attributes of a
   feature.  Thanks to Jillian Rowe and Colin Davenport for pointing
   out the need for this.

 * Fixed arrowheads on HTMLFeatures not always being visible when the
   viewing region is being panned back and forth.  Thanks to Gregg
   Helt for pointing this out.

 * Fixed a bug in which editing a track's configuration JSON through
   the track menu when the faceted track selector was enabled
   sometimes caused another track to be deactivated.  Thanks to Steffi
   Geisen for pointing this out.

 * Fixed a subtle bug in which not completing a track-dragging gesture
   from the Simple track selector into the genome view caused the
   track handle to not disappear from the track selector when the
   track is turned on later.  Thanks to Gregg Helt for pointing this
   out.

 * Fixed a bug in which `prepare-refseqs.pl` can crash when used with
   Bio::DB::Das::BioSQL.  Thanks to Brian Osborne for contributing the
   fix.

 * Fixed failures of setup.sh legacy BAM support installation caused
   by samtools taking down their old SourceForge subversion
   repository.

 * Fixed a bug in which highlighted regions were not always drawn
   correctly at initial load time.  Thanks to Steffi Geisen for
   pointing this out.

 * Added support for a `plugins->[]->location` configuration
   attribute, making it possible for plugins to be loaded from outside
   the JBrowse plugins directory.

 * Fixed a bug in which Wiggle track value displays behaved a bit
   oddly with some kinds of mouse movements.  Thanks to Gwendoline
   Andres for pointing this out.

 * Added a `logMessages` global configuration variable that, if set to
   true, records messages on the JBrowse message bus in the browser
   log.

 * Added a workaround for problems with some types of nonstandard Perl
   installations.  Thanks to Rebecca Boes for pointing this out.

# Release 1.9.4     2013-05-22 14:03:32 EST5EDT

 * Fixed a bug with configuration handling that preventing disabling
   right-click feature menus, and probably had other undesirable
   effects.  Thanks to Daniel Troesser for pointing this out
   (issue #260).

 * Fixed a bug in which facet renaming specified in the
   `trackSelector.renameFacets` configuration variable was not
   properly applied to facet titles in the accordion widget on the
   left side of the faceted track selector (issue #251).  Thanks to
   Jason Gao for pointing this out.

 * Fixed a bug with GFF3 and Sequin Table export of GFF3
   alternate_allele attributes.  Thanks to Jillian Rowe for pointing
   this out (issue #256).

 * Fixed some hard-coded image paths that were not respecting the
   setting of the `browserRoot` configuration variable.  Thanks to
   Harry Yoo for pointing this out (issue #258).

 * Fixed a bug in which running `biodb-to-json.pl` with no arguments
   caused it to crash instead of producing help output.  Thanks to
   GitHub user sreyesch for pointing this out (issue #257).

 * Fixed a bug in which some browsers report that
   src/dijit/_editor/nls/commands.js is missing.  Thanks to Steffi
   Geisen for pointing this out.

# Release 1.9.3     2013-05-09 12:42:39 EST5EDT

 * Fixed a bug in VCF backend that prevented display of VCF features
   containing lines in which the ALT column was '.' or not provided.
   Thanks to Ignazio Carbone for pointing this out.

 * Fixed a display bug in faceted track selector in which selected
   facets that have no available matches were squashed to the left
   side.

 * Fixed issue with HTMLVariants track type not being available for
   selection from the File->Open dialog.

# Release 1.9.2     2013-05-02 13:30:12 EST5EDT

 * Fixed bug in which JBrowse could not properly display all data in
   BAM files with reference sequence name sections bigger than 64KB.
   Thanks to GitHub user lfgu for pointing this out (issue #245).

 * Made REST feature store backend less sensitive more tolerant of
   stringification of `start`, `end`, `strand`, and `score` in feature
   JSON.  Thanks to Matt Bomhoff for pointing this out.

 * Fixed bug in which URLs for plugin resources were not assembled
   relative to the `browserRoot` config variable.  Thanks to Matt
   Bomhoff for pointing this out.

 * Fixed bug in which missing fields in a VCF variant's genotype
   prevented display of a variant's details.  Thanks to Jillian Rowe
   for pointing this out.

 * Fixed some minor issues related to the handling of empty BigWig
   files.  Thanks to Nathan Boley for pointing this out (issue #252).

 * The `trackSelector.type` global config variable can now contain
   fully-qualified class names, so plugins can contain their own
   tracklist classes.  Thanks to Matt Bomhoff for pointing this out.

 * Moved the "Select tracks" tab used to open the faceted track
   selector downward, so that it does not block access to the left
   side of the reference sequence overview.

# Release 1.9.1     2013-04-25 12:02:25 EST5EDT

 * Significant speed and memory optimizations in BAM data backend
   (issue #242).

 * Significant speed and memory optimizations in VCF data backend.

 * JBrowse now attempts to smooth over mismatches in the naming of
   reference sequences between various datasets.  For instance, if a
   BAM file contains reference sequences named like "chrom1", and the
   canonical reference sequences used in a JBrowse installation are
   named like "chr1", JBrowse will recognize these two names as
   equivalent for the purposes of displaying the BAM data.  This
   behavior can be disabled by setting the global configuration
   variable `exactReferenceSequenceNames` to `true`. (issue #239).

 * Removed support for track `blockDisplayTimeout` configuration
   variable.  It never worked very well, and the problem it was meant
   to address (delays caused by large data) are better mitigated by
   `maxHeight` and the faster rendering offered by canvas-based track
   types.

 * Fixed a bug that prevented displaying some VCF files.  Thanks to
   Steffi Geisen for pointing this out.

 * Reduced the default value of `maxHeight` for canvas-based feature
   tracks (like Alignments2) from 1000 to 600.

 * Fixed a bug in the `Alignments` track type where BAM features with
   missing mate pairs that are not drawn due to their position above
   the track's `maxHeight` caused the track rendering to crash.
   Thanks to Tristan Lubinski for reporting this.

 * If no global `refSeqOrder` is specified in the configuration, the
   reference sequences are now not sorted.  Currently, this means that
   they will appear in the same order as loaded by
   `prepare-refseqs.pl`.  Users with a very large number of (more than
   10,000) reference sequences may wish to avoid specifying a
   `refSeqOrder`, since sorting the reference sequences is done at
   JBrowse startup time.  Thanks to Tristan Lubinski for reporting
   this.

 * Fixed bug preventing display of quantitative data from files loaded
   with flatfile-to-json.pl.  Thanks to Gwendoline Andres for pointing
   this out.

 * Instead of quantitative (wiggle) tracks throwing an error when they
   cannot choose a min and max for the display scale, they now just
   make a guess.  While probably wrong, this at least has the track
   displaying something, and users can then look up how to fix the
   display scale.

 * Added support for a `chunkSizeLimit` configuration variable for BAM
   and VCF-based tracks, which defaults to 5MB for BAM and 15MB for
   VCF.  When fetching data, if a given region requires fetching a
   file chunk that is larger than this limit, a 'Too much data'
   message is displayed.  This helps prevent speed and memory problems
   when displaying deep-coverage BAM tracks and large VCF tracks
   (issue #242).  Thanks to Gustavo Cerquiera (GitHub user cerca11)
   for pushing for progress on this.

 * Fixed a regression in which callbacks and interpolations were not
   evaluated in left-click and right-click menu configurations.

 * Fixed incorrect display of negative values in log-scale wiggle
   tracks.  Thanks to GitHub user drusch for pointing this out
   (issue #244).

 * Fixed more minor errors when running under IE 7.

 * Fixed "Max height reached" message sometimes being drawn under
   instead of over HTML-based features.

# Release 1.9.0     2013-04-16 18:59:19 EST5EDT

 * Added a direct-access data backend for reading variation data
   directly from VCF files that have been compressed with `bgzip` and
   indexed with `tabix`.  See the JBrowse Configuration Guide on the
   GMOD wiki for details about how to add directly-displayed VCF files
   (issue #211).

 * Added a new `HTMLVariants` track type based on HTMLFeatures with a
   feature-details popup optimized for displaying variant details.

 * Added a text box at the top of the simple (i.e. the default) track
   selector that finds tracks in the track list matching the typed
   text (issue #210).

 * Added support for `autoscale: "local"` in Wiggle, FeatureCoverage,
   and SNPCoverage tracks, which automatically sets the scale of the
   y-axis based on the range of the data being displayed in the
   current view.  Thanks to Gregor Rot and Raymond Wan for championing
   the need for this (issue #203).

 * Added an optional dropdown selector in the menu bar that allows
   switching between multiple datasets.  To enable it, add a
   `datasets` array in your JBrowse configuration, and set a
   `dataset_id` in each of the `trackList.json` (or other) files that
   are optionally loaded by the dataset selector.  See the JBrowse
   Configuration Guide on the GMOD wiki for details (issue #134).

 * Added a new datastore class, `JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/REST` that
   fetches data from any back end system that implements the simple
   REST API it uses.  See the JBrowse Configuration Guide for details
   on how to implement its REST API.  Thanks to Brett Thomas, Daniel
   Troesser, and Brad Chapman for pointing out the need for this
   (issue #227).

 * By default, JBrowse now continuously updates the browser's URL bar
   to contain a URL that will show the current JBrowse view directly.
   This is enabled by default only if JBrowse is running from the
   default index.html included in the JBrowse distribution.

 * HTMLFeatures, Alignments, and Alignments2 tracks now accept a
   `maxHeight` configuration variable specifying the maximum displayed
   height of a track in pixels.  Features that would cause the track
   to grow beyond its maximum height will not be drawn (issue #222).

 * Removed the `refSeqDropdown` configuration variable; the reference
   sequence selector is now shown for any number of reference
   sequences, with its length limited by the `refSeqSelectorMaxSize`
   variable (see next item).

 * Added support for optional `refSeqSelectorMaxSize` and
   `refSeqOrder` global configuration variables that set the maximum
   length of the reference sequence dropdown selector, and specify the
   sort order of the reference sequences in that selector,
   respectively.  One instance in which this is particularly useful is
   in displaying annotations on early-stage, incomplete genomic
   assemblies: to display the N biggest contigs in the assembly in the
   reference sequence selector dropdown, one can set `refSeqOrder` to
   `length descending`, and set `refSeqSelectorMaxSize` to N.  Thanks
   to Ignazio Carbone for pointing out the need for this. (issues #234
   and #235).

 * Fixed some bugs causing memory leaks when scrolling and zooming,
   especially on tracks with a lot of data like BAM tracks.  Thanks to
   Gustavo Cerquiera for pointing this out (issue #220).

 * HTMLFeatures tracks now accept `style->label` and
   `style->description` configuration variables variable that can be
   set to a function callback that returns a string with the feature's
   label or long description, respectively (issue #9).

 * Wiggle/XYPlot, Wiggle/Density, and FeatureCoverage tracks now
   accept function callbacks in their `style->pos_color`,
   `style->neg_color`, `style->bg_color`, and
   `style->clip_marker_color` configuration variables.  Function
   callbacks are passed two arguments: the feature object (with start
   bp, end bp, and score of the quanititative region being shown, and
   the track object (which can be used to access track configuration
   data, along with many other things).  (issue #133).

 * Wiggle/XYPlot tracks now accept an array for their `variance_band`
   argument, allowing users to set the position of the variance bands
   to show (issue #133).

 * Wiggle/XYPlot tracks now accept a `style->variance_band_color`
   configuration variable, allowing users to set the colors of the
   variance bands. The variance band color should usually be specified
   with a partial opacity.  Default is 'rgba(0,0,0,0.3)', which is
   black with 30% opacity (issue #133).

 * Added an "About JBrowse" popup dialog, which supports an
   `aboutThisBrowser` configuration stanza containing a title for the
   main browser window, and a description to be shown in a pop-up
   dialog when the title is clicked (issue #206).

 * Where possible (i.e. supported by the data store), JBrowse will now
   pop up a warning if a local data file is opened that contains no
   data for the current reference sequence (issue #178).

 * Fixed bug in which hard- and soft-clipped regions were erroneously
   counted toward the overall length of a BAM alignment (issue #229).

 * Fixed bug in which dragging the vertical scroll bar marker on the
   right side of the track pane did not behave correctly. (Julien
   Smith-Roberge, issue #223).

 * Fixed bug in which the navigation location for some reference
   sequences can get messed up when ref.start != 0, or ref.end !=
   ref.length (issue #215).

 * Fixed bug in which, when using the dynamic zooming tool
   (rubber-band zooming), some browsers (particularly Safari) would
   inaccurately display the locations of HTML-based features and
   per-basepair colored bars in sequence tracks.

 * Fixed bug in which navigating via sequence dropdown selection
   ignores previous location on selected sequence, whereas with
   navigation text box entering just a sequence name navigates to
   previous location on that sequence (if visited previously).  Thanks
   to Gregg Helt for implementing this fix (issue #216).

 * Fixed bug in which the initial default view of a previously
   unviewed reference sequencestarts at 80% centered view, but any use
   of reference sequence selection pulldown takes it to 100%.  Big
   thanks to Gregg Helt for implementing this fix (issue #217).

 * Fixed bug in which iframe popups did not display correctly in
   Internet Explorer 9.  Thanks to Steffi Geisen for pointing this out
   (issue #233).

 * Fixed a number of bugs that prevented JBrowse from running in
   Internet Explorer 7 and 8 (issue #236).

 * Improved JSON syntax error messages in server-side scripts
   (issue #214).

 * Increased the default display timeout (`blockDisplayTimeout`) on
   HTML-based features tracks from 5 seconds to 20 seconds.

 * Added a `new-plugin.pl` helper script that makes the skeleton of a
   new JBrowse plugin.

 * Added an `add-json.pl` helper script that advanced users can use to
   set arbitrary value in JSON files from the command line.

 * Fixed a bug in which the `--conf` option to `prepare-refseqs.pl`
   did not support comments in JSON conf files (issue #213).  Thanks
   to Keiran Raine for pointing this out.

 * Fixed some missing dojo/dijit nls directories in the non-dev
   release zipfile.

 * Fixed a bug with handling of timeout events in HTMLFeatures tracks.
   Thanks to Matt Henderson of KBase for pointing this out.

# Release 1.8.1     2013-02-12 12:56:24 EST5EDT

 * Added support for `cigarAttribute` and `mdAttributes` configuration
   variables to Alignments and Alignments2 tracks, allowing users to
   change which feature attribute is used for showing mismatches
   (issue #200).

 * Fixed some bugs preventing `Alignments` and `Alignments2` tracks
   from working with non-BAM data backends.

 * Added `--trackLabel` and `--key` options to `prepare-refseqs.pl`,
   allowing users to specify the sequence track's label and title.

 * Added `--seqType` option to `prepare-refseqs.pl`, allowing users to
   specify the type of sequences being formatted, usually either
   'dna', 'rna', or 'protein'.  Additionally, if --seqType is
   something over than DNA (case insensitive), "showReverseStrand" is
   set to false on the reference sequence track.

 * `prepare-refseqs.pl` now calls the track showing the reference
   sequence "Reference sequence" instead of "DNA".

 * Added a `shareURL` configuration option that accepts a JS function
   to assemble the URL that users will get when clicking the "Share"
   button or the "Full view" link in embedded mode (issue #198).

 * Fixed annoying bug in which popup feature detail boxes are
   initially scrolled all the way to the bottom.

# Release 1.8.0     2013-01-31 14:05:27 America/New_York

 * Added new "File -> Open" function that can display BAM, BigWig, and
   GFF3 files located on the user's machine, at remote URLs, or a
   mixture of both.  When opening local files, everything is done
   locally, no data is transferred to the server.

 * Added a new "SNPCoverage" track type, designed for use with BAM
   files (but which works with any features that have MD fields), that
   shows a coverage plot with a graphical representation of SNP
   distribution, and tables showing frequencies for each SNP.

 * Added a new "Alignments2" track type, which is a much faster
   implementation of the "Alignments" track type.  It is more suitable
   for very deep BAM alignments, but has a slightly different
   configuration scheme.

 * Added a flexible plugin system whereby external code can be loaded
   as part of JBrowse.  Plugin JavaScript has full access to customize
   nearly everything in JBrowse.  The plugin system is quite new, but
   many hooks are available that plugins can use to safely modify
   JBrowse's behavior, and more are on the way.  See the JBrowse wiki
   for details on how to write your own plugins.  Thanks to Gregg Helt
   and the other members of the WebApollo project for helping to drive
   development of the new plugin system.

 * JBrowse feature name indexing (`generate-names.pl`) now uses an
   all-new hash-based filesystem backend.  Although
   `generate-names.pl` now takes longer to run, it can handle much
   larger numbers of names to index, and uses much less RAM to do it.
   As a side benefit, the JBrowse location box's autocompletion
   feature is now faster and more reliable.  Thanks to Steffi Geisen
   and Volodymyr Zavidovych for pointing out the issues with name
   indexing scalability and reliability.

 * Added support in "HTMLFeatures", "Alignments", and "Alignments2"
   tracks for a `style.featureScale` configuration variable, which, if
   set, specifies a minimum zoom scale (pixels per basepair) for
   displaying features.  If zoomed out more than this (i.e. fewer
   pixels per bp), either histograms or a "too many features" message
   will be displayed.

 * Changed binning algorithm of "FeatureCoverage" tracks when zoomed
   out.  Now calculates the average base coverage in each bin, rather
   than the absolute number of features that overlap each bin.

 * "HTMLFeatures" tracks now accept a comma-separated list of field
   names in their `description` configuration variable, allowing users
   to customize which attribute(s) of a feature hold the description.

 * Added a timeout to HTMLFeatures and Alignments tracks to prevent
   data-heavy tracks (like BAM tracks with very deep coverage) from
   freezing or crashing a user's browser.

 * Improved graphical look of canvas-based tracks during zoom
   operations.  Thanks to Mitch Skinner for implementing this!

 * Fixed a bug in which the Y-axis scale for feature density
   histograms in HTMLFeatures tracks was sometimes drawn incorrectly.

 * Greatly improved speed and responsiveness of BAM data backend.

 * Fixed yet another bug that prevented display of some types of BAM files.

# Release 1.7.6     2013-01-10 01:25:58 America/New_York

 * Fixed a bug in the BAM direct-access backend that prevented some
   BAM files from being displayed.

# Release 1.7.5     2012-12-12 13:40:12 America/New_York

 * Fixed a bug in which typing a key that is bound to a global
   keyboard shortcut (currently only 't' or '?') in the location box
   would erroneously execute the action for that global shortcut.
   Thanks to Gregor Rot for pointing this out.

 * Fixed a bug in which toggling 'Show labels' in the track menu did
   not re-layout the track on the first toggling.

 * Make columns in the faceted track selector initially each be an
   equal percentage of the total width of the grid.  Thanks to Steffi
   Geisen for pointing this out.

# Release 1.7.4     2012-12-06 23:08:22 America/New_York

 * Fixed a bug preventing loading of JBrowse in some browsers.  Thanks
   to Steffi Geisen for pointing this out.

 * Fixed a bug in the BigWig data backend that prevented some BigWig
   files with large numbers of reference sequences from displaying.
   Thanks to Gregg Helt for providing sample data to help isolate
   this.

 * Fixed a bug in the BigWig data backend that prevented BigWig files
   rendering in Safari.  Thanks to Gregor Rot for his help in isolating this.

 * Worked around a bug in Safari 6 (and probably earlier) in which
   HTTP byte-range requests are erroneously cached.  Thanks to Gregor
   Rot for pointing out the Safari problems.

 * Fixed some minor styling bugs in the facet menus of the faceted
   track selector.

 * Fixed blurry edges of location trapezoid in Firefox (Eric Derohanian).

# Release 1.7.3     2012-11-28 23:29:48 America/New_York

 * Fixed several more bugs in the BAM data backend that prevented
   display of some BAM files.  Thanks to Gleb Kuznetzov for help in
   isolating these.

 * Fixed bug in display of faceted track selector in which the facet
   titles were taking up too much vertical height.  Thanks to Steffi
   Geisen for pointing this out.

 * "Alignments" tracks now parse an alignment's CIGAR string if it
   does not have an MD field, and display mismatches and skipped
   sequence regions (particularly important for RNA-seq alignments).
   Thanks to Gregg Helt for providing the sample dataset used to test
   this.

 * Added support for a `showReverseStrand` config variable to Sequence
   track that, if set to false, turns off display of the reverse
   sequence strand.

 * "Alignments" tracks now show reads with missing mate pairs with a
   red crosshatched pattern instead of with a red border.

 * Added an Apache .htaccess file to the JBrowse root directory that
   enabled CORS by default for all files under it, if AllowOverride is
   on.

 * Fixed bug in which the vertical scroll position can sometimes be
   set too far down when zooming in and out.

 * Fixed some bugs in server-side formatting code for feature tracks:
   data was recorded multiple times in JSON files in some
   circumstances.  Thanks to Volodymyr Zavidovych and Steffi Geisen
   for pointing this out.

# Release 1.7.2     2012-11-09 15:40:06 America/New_York

 * Fixed more bugs in BAM backends that failed to load some types of
   BAM files, including BAM files containing no alignments.  Thanks to
   John St. John for his assistance in isolating the problem.

# Release 1.7.1     2012-11-07 11:25:39 America/New_York

 * Fixed bug in which bars below the origin of `Wiggle/XYPlot` were
   drawn incorrectly (issue #161).  Thanks to GitHub user @makela for
   pointing this out.

 * `Wiggle/XYPlot` tracks now by default draw a horizontal line at the
   origin, and support a `style.origin_color` configuration variable
   to set its color or turn it off.

 * Fixed bug in BAM backend that caused an infinite loop and/or
   browser crash with some BAM files.  Thanks to Gleb Kuznetzov for
   pointing this out.

# Release 1.7.0     2012-11-05 19:22:17 America/New_York

 * Added a new direct-access storage driver for BAM files, removing
   the need for `bam-to-json.pl`.  This new method of BAM access is
   far superior to the old `bam-to-json.pl` in nearly every way,
   except in browser compatibility.  Like the BigWig direct access
   backend added in JBrowse 1.5.0, it is based on code from Thomas
   Down's Dalliance Genome Explorer, and works in all major browsers
   *except* Internet Explorer, because IE lacks support for the
   necessary web standards.  It may work with Internet Explorer 10,
   but this has not been tested yet.

 * Added a new `Alignments` track type designed to work seamlessly
   with BAM files.  This track type shows basepair differences and
   insertions between aligned reads and the reference, and highlights
   reads with missing mate-pairs in red.

 * Added the ability to export track data in FASTA, GFF3, bed,
   bedGraph, and Wiggle formats (issue #104).  To export data, turn on
   the track of interest, then click on its track label to bring up
   the track menu, and select "Save track data".

 * Added a new `Wiggle/Density` track type, analagous to the GBrowse
   `wiggle_density` glyph type.  Shows the Wiggle information using
   varying intensity of color (issue #66).  Renamed the `Wiggle` track
   to `Wiggle/XYPlot`, and made the old `Wiggle` track type an alias
   to `Wiggle/XYPlot`.

 * Both `Wiggle/XYPlot` and `Wiggle/Density` now support a `style ->
   bg_color` option.  Color-density plots blend the `pos_color` or
   `neg_color` into the `bg_color` in amounts that vary with the
   wiggle data, and xyplots fill the background color behind all
   points that have data present, regardless of value.  `bg_color`
   defaults to off for xy xplots, and semi-transparent gray for
   density plots.  Setting this makes it easier for users to
   distinguish at a glance between regions with no data, and regions
   with a value of 0.

 * Added a new `FeatureCoverage` track type, which shows a
   dynamically-computed XY-plot of the depth of coverage of features
   across a genome.  One good use of this track type is to provide a
   quick coverage plot directly from a BAM file.  However, since this
   track calculates coverage on the fly, it can be slow when used with
   large regions or very deep coverage.  In this case, it is
   recommended to generate a BigWig file containing the coverage data,
   and display it with a `Wiggle/XYPlot` or `Wiggle/Density` track.

 * DNA bases are now displayed with color-coded backgrounds, allowing
   basepair information to be discerned when zoomed somewhat further
   out, when base letter cannot be drawn.  Colors are also designed to
   match the base-mismatch colors used in `Alignment` tracks, enabling
   clearer SNP visualization.

 * Added a vertical line cursor and labels showing the current
   basepair position of the mouse when hovering over the scale bar, or
   when doing a rubber-band zoom (Erik Derohanian) (issue #32).

 * Added an animation to make it easier to see where in the track
   selection list a closed track has gone, when using the simple track
   selector (issue #151).

 * Information dialog boxes are now easier to dismiss: clicking
   anywhere outside of them, or pressing any key, will make them go
   away.

 * Improvements to feature track configuration:
   * Feature tracks no longer use the `style.subfeatureScale`
     configuration variable to determine whether to show subfeatures.
     Instead, subfeatures are shown if the parent feature, when shown on
     the screen, is wider than `style.minSubfeatureWidth`, which
     defaults to 6 pixels.
   * Make explicitly-configured track `labelScale`, `histScale`, and
     `descriptionScale` not be modulated by the feature density: only
     use the feature density to pick the scale defaults

 * The default feature-detail dialog box now shows more information, adding:
   * the feature's exact length
   * full details of its subfeatures

 * Added a `locationBoxLength` configuration variable that controls
   the width of the location box.  In addition, the default width of
   the location box is now also smarter.  Instead of a fixed 25
   characters, it is calculated to fit the largest location string
   that is likely to be produced, based on the length of the reference
   sequences and the length of their names.

 * Pressing SHIFT+-up/down arrow keys now cause the genome view to
   zoom in and out.  If ALT is added, it zooms further.  Thanks to
   Karsten Hokamp for the excellent suggestion.

 * Holding SHIFT while scrolling left and right with the arrow keys
   causes the view to scroll further.

 * Added a `theme` configuration variable to allow changing the
   graphical theme to something different from the default "tundra".
   However, no other themes are implemented yet.

 * Greatly sped up rendering of HTML subfeatures by caching the
   heights of subfeature HTML elements.

 * Fixed bug in which the genome view executed a double-click zoom when
   users rapidly clicked on multiple track 'close' buttons.

 * Fixed bug with the genome view scrolling in response to arrow keys
   being pressed when typing in the location box.

 * Fixed bug in which the score display in Wiggle tracks would
   sometimes flicker when moving the mouse.

# Release 1.6.5     2012-10-26 12:10:08 America/New_York

 * The location box now shows the length of the currently visible
   region in parentheses.  For example: `ctgB:1244..3566 (2.32 Kb)`.
   Thanks to Karsten Hokamp for the suggestion!

 * The arrow keys on the keyboard can now be used to pan and scroll
   around the genome view.

 * Wiggle track mouseover cursors now display the score with only 6
   significant digits, avoiding confusion over approximations
   introduced by scores being converted to IEEE floating-point numbers
   (as for BigWig files) and back to text.

 * The faceted track selector now renders any HTML that may be present
   in the track metadata by default.  To turn this off, it now accepts
   an `escapeHTMLInData` option that, if set to `true` or `1`, will
   not render the HTML, but will instead display the raw code
   (issue #145).

 * Upgraded to a more recent version of jszlib, which contains some
   important bugfixes (issue #157).

 * Fixed bug dealing with very large regions with the same value in
   canvas-based Wiggle tracks (also issue #157).

 * `prepare-refseqs.pl` now by default uses a more scalable directory
   structure for storing sequences.  This fixes problems some users
   were experiencing with large numbers of reference sequences
   (issue #139).

 * `ucsc-to-json.pl` now supports a `--primaryName` option allowing
   the users to alter which UCSC data field is displayed by JBrowse as
   the primary name of the features in a track.  Also,
   `ucsc-to-json.pl` now treats as indexable names all UCSC data
   columns called "name", "alias", or "id" followed by zero or more
   digits.  Thanks to Steffi Geisen for this suggestion.

 * Fixed "Duplicate specification" warnings coming from
   `flatfile-to-json.pl` and `remove-track.pl`.

 * Fixed bugs in which both the first few and the last few bases of a
   reference sequence were not displaying correctly in a DNA track.

# Release 1.6.4     2012-10-16 11:50:44 America/New_York

 * Improvements to the scalability of `generate-names.pl`.  Many
   thanks to Steffi Geisen for her ongoing help with this.
    * Users can now manually specify which tracks will be indexed to
      enable autocompletion and searching for their feature names in
      the JBrowse location box.
    * The lazy-trie name indexing structure now correctly handles the
      case of large numbers of features that may share the same
      name. Before, it was generating files that were too large for
      the client to handle.

 * Fixed off-by-one error in Wiggle track display code: wiggle data
   was incorrectly displayed shifted one base to the left of its
   proper position.  Thanks to Steffi Geisen for noticing this.

 * Fixed bug in which the reference-sequence selection box did not
   automatically update in all situations to reflect the current
   reference sequence.

# Release 1.6.3     2012-09-28 11:33:36 America/New_York

 * Fixed bug with shift-rubberband-zooming not working on Windows
   (issue #150) (Erik Derohanian).

 * Fixed "Can't locate JSON.pm" errors with add-track-json.pl.

 * Added a reference-sequence-selection dropdown box, similar to the
   old one, that is on by default if fewer than 30 reference
   sequences, otherwise it's off unless `refSeqDropdown: true` is set
   in the configuration (issue #138).

 * Fixed bug in which popup dialog boxes showing other websites showed
   the website in only the top portion of the dialog box.  Only
   present in some browsers (issue #149).

 * Fix coordinate display bug in feature detail popups.  The feature's
   position was being displayed in interbase coordinates, but should
   be displayed in 1-based coordinates.  Thanks to Steffi Geisen for
   pointing this out.

 * Added a `style.height` option to Wiggle tracks to control the
   track's height in pixels (issue #131) (Erik Derohanian).

 * Added support for a `style.trackLabelCss` configuration variable to
   allow customizing the appearance of the label for a particular
   track (issue #4) (Erik Derohanian).

# Release 1.6.2     2012-09-10 17:47:43 America/New_York

 * Fixed feature-layout performance problem when zoomed very far in
   on features that are much larger than the viewing window.

 * Added a default `menuTemplate` to all HTML-based features, so that
   all HTML features now have a right-click menu by default.

 * Add `css` configuration variable that allows users to specify
   either strings or URLs containing CSS to add.

 * improved `bin/ucsc-to-json.pl` error messages

 * `bin/add-track-json.pl` now replaces tracks in the target
   configuration if they have the same label.

# Release 1.6.1     2012-08-28 16:50:41 America/New_York

 * JBrowse now attempts to prevent feature labels being obscured by
   track labels by keeping the feature labels a bit further away from
   the left side of the view, if possible.

 * Fixed bug in which welcome page was not shown when JBrowse has not
   been configured yet (issue #130).

 * Fixed bug in which passing `tracklist=0` (as when running the
   browser in embedded mode) caused JBrowse to crash (issue #132).

 * Added dependency on Bio::GFF3::LowLevel::Parser 1.4, which has an
   important bugfix related to multi-location features (issue #109).
   Thanks to Victor Poten for help in isolating this problem.

# Release 1.6.0     2012-08-25 18:04:44 America/New_York

 * Added `description` capabilities to HTML-based features, similar to
   GBrowse's descriptions.  If zoomed in far enough (as defined by
   `style.descriptionScale`), adds a second line of text below the
   feature's label that shows the content's of the featur's `Note` or
   `description` attribute (issue #67).

 * Give prepare-refseqs.pl the capability to load reference sequences
   from embedded FASTA sections in GFF3 files (issue #128).

 * Configuration files can now recursively `include` eachother, and
   `tracks` sections are merged intelligently.

 * Made sequence tracks not disappear when zoomed out too far to see
   base pairs.  Instead, sequence tracks simply display lines
   suggesting that DNA would be visible at higher
   magnification. (issue #124).

 * Double-clicking track labels in the simple track selector now turns
   the track on (issue #123).

 * Fixed bug in BigWig tracks that use the "scale": "log" option: did
   not render properly when the wiggle data included 0's. This was due
   to the fact that the origin was being mapped to Infinity. Thanks to
   the [Mockler Lab](http://www.mocklerlab.org/) for the fix! (issue
   #127).

 * Fixed bug in NCList binary search code in which zero-length
   features at node boundaries would not be found (fix by Ed Lee).

 * Fixed bug in which dragging the scroll bar on the simple track
   selector can sometimes cause a drag-and-drop to erroneously begin
   (issue #89).

 * Fixed some bugs in the layout of HTML-based features in which
   features in different blocks would overlap in some circumstances.
   Under the hood, replaced the contour-based layout engine with a
   simpler, not-much-slower implementation that is more correct in the
   general case (issue #122).

 * Fixed a bug with vertical centering of strand arrows and other
   sub-elements of HTML-based features.

# Release 1.5.0     2012-08-13 15:37:27 America/New_York

 * Added a direct-access storage driver for BigWig data files, based
   on code from the Dalliance Genome Explorer by Thomas Down.  BigWig
   file access is supported now by the current versions of all major
   browsers except Internet Explorer (which is expected to work when
   version 10 is released along with Windows 8).

 * Added a `canvas`-based wiggle track implementation for quantitative
   data that, when used with the new BigWig storage backend, removes
   the need to pre-generate rendered images of wiggle data.  Its
   display is also highly configurable, with configuration options
   modeled on the GBrowse `wiggle_xyplot` glyph type
   (i.e. `Bio::Graphics::Glyph::wiggle_xyplot`).

 * Added highly configurable behavior for left-clicking and
   right-clicking features in HTML-based feature tracks.  If a
   `menuTemplate` option is specified in the track configuration,
   right-clicking a feature brings up a context menu, the items in
   which can be configured to do nearly anything, but that are easy to
   configure for the very common use case of wanting to display
   content from a certain URL.  Feature left-clicks are also
   configurable using the same mechanism.  Thanks to Alexie
   Papanicolaou and Temi Varghese for the initial implementation of
   context menus.

 * Improved the default HTML feature left-click dialog box.  It is now
   both prettier, and more comprehensive, displaying all available
   data for the feature.

 * Added the long-missing ability to render a second line of label
   text for features containing their description, which is taken from
   the feature's 'Note' or 'description' attribute, if present.  The
   description is only displayed if the track's `description`
   configuration variable is set to a true value, which is the
   default.  There is also a style.maxDescriptionLength value, that
   can be set to control how long a description can be before it is
   truncated with ellipses.  It defaults to 70 characters.

 * Added a small helper script, `add-track-json.pl` that developers
   and advanced users can use to programmatically add a block of track
   configuration JSON to an existing JBrowse configuration file.

 * Improved / fixed vertical alignment of sub-elements of HTML
   features, including subfeatures and the arrowheads that show
   strand.  All elements in a feature are now vertically centered by
   default.

# Release 1.4.2     2012-07-12 15:38:55 America/New_York

 * Restore support for histScale, subfeatureScale, and labelScale in
   --clientConfig and track configuration JSON.  Thanks to Hernán
   Bondino for pointing this out.

# Release 1.4.1     2012-07-10 14:58:34 America/New_York

 * Made displayColumns option for the faceted track selector
   case-insensitive, and interpret a column name of "Name" as meaning
   the track's key.

 * `bam-to-json.pl` now filters out alignments that are not at least
   two nucleotides in length.  Thanks to Tristan Lubinski for
   assistance.

 * Introduced limits on the sizes of cookies that can be set,
   preventing '400 bad request' errors (issue #113).

# Release 1.4.0     2012-06-14 17:43:50 America/New_York

 * Added a full-featured faceted track selector for users that have
   many (hundreds or thousands) of tracks.  This can be turned on by
   setting the `trackSelectorType` config variable to "Faceted".  See
   the JBrowse wiki for more documentation on how to use faceted track
   selection. (issue #95)

 * Removed the dropdown selector for reference sequences in favor of
   making the location box auto-complete reference sequence and
   feature names.  This makes JBrowse much more scalable to large
   numbers of reference sequences. (fixes issues #3, #60, and #101)

 * Added a vertical-scrolling marker on the right side of the track
   pane, making it much easier to discern the vertical position of the
   track display. (issue #93).

 * biodb-to-json.pl and flatfile-to-json.pl now load all available
   feature data: all attributes of features are now encoded in the
   JSON and are available for use by feature callbacks. (issue #72)

 * Feature labels now do not scroll off screen if any part of the
   feature is still visible (fixes issue #62).

 * Added jbrowse_conf.json, a default JSON-format configuration file,
   to the JBrowse root directory.  Makes it easier to get started
   with more advanced JBrowse configuration.

 * JBrowse instances now report usage statistics to the JBrowse
   developers.  This data is very important to the JBrowse project,
   since it is used to make the case to grant agencies for continuing
   to fund JBrowse development.  No research data is transmitted, the
   data collected is limited to standard Google Analytics, along with
   a count of how many tracks the JBrowse instance has, how many
   reference sequences are present, their average length, and what
   types of tracks (wiggle, feature, etc) are present.  Users can
   disable usage statistics by setting "suppressUsageStatistics: true"
   in the JBrowse configuration.

# Release 1.3.1     2012-04-19 17:55:44 America/New_York

 * Fixed memory-management bug that caused way too much RAM to be used
   by FeatureTrack loading (flatfile, bam, and biodb-to-json.pl) when
   loading with very large numbers of reference sequences.  Big thanks
   to Tristan Lubinski for help in isolating this.

 * Fixed some bugs in BAM support section of setup.sh autosetup
   script, thanks to Tristan Lubinski for help in isolating this as
   well.

 * Added an example document with an iframe running JBrowse in
   embedded mode in docs/examples/embedded_mode.html

 * flatfile-to-json.pl now loads the 'score' attribute of features in the
   JSON.

# Release 1.3.0     2012-04-13 17:04:30 America/New_York

 * Added support for "rubberband" dynamic zooming, in which users can
   click and drag to select a region to zoom to.  Dragging on any
   scale bar, or shift-dragging on the main track pane, triggers a
   dynamic zoom.

 * Correcting a long-standing oversight, wiggle data tracks and
   feature histograms now have numerical y-axis scales that show the
   numerical values of the data.

 * Server-side data-formatting scripts now support a --compress option
   to compress (gzip) feature and sequence data to conserve server
   disk space.  Using this option requires some web server
   configuration.  Under Apache, AllowOverride FileInfo (or
   AllowOverride All) must be set for the JBrowse data directories in
   order to use the included .htaccess files, and mod_headers and
   mod_setenvif must be installed and enabled.  Under nginx a
   configuration snippet like the following should be included in the
   configuration:

      location ~* "\.(json|txt)z$" {
               add_header Content-Encoding  gzip;
               gzip off;
               types { application/json jsonz; }
      }

 * flatfile-to-json.pl: now much faster and more memory-efficient,
   especially for GFF3 files.  Remember that '###' directives are very
   important to have in large GFF3 files!  Also removed nonfunctional
   --extraData switch.

 * Added ability to turn off some JBrowse UI panels via URL arguments
   to the default index.html, or via arguments to the Browser
   constructor itself.  Can dynamically turn off the navigation box,
   the overview panel, and the track list, respectively.  When all of
   these are off, and if run in an iframe, JBrowse is running in an
   "embedded mode" that looks similar to the output of GBrowse's
   gbrowse_img script, with the exception that the view in this case
   is a fully functioning, scrollable and zoomable JBrowse.  See the
   GMOD wiki (http://gmod.org/wiki/JBrowse) for more on how to set up
   embedded mode.  Thanks to Julie Moon, a co-op student working at
   OICR, for this work!

 * Improved graphical look and feel.

 * Browser support for this release:
      * Google Chrome 18                perfect
      * Google Chrome 17                perfect
      * Mozilla Firefox 11.0            perfect
      * Mozilla Firefox 10.1            perfect
      * Mozilla Firefox 10.0.2          perfect
      * Mozilla Firefox 3.6.28          nonfunctional
      * Apple Safari 5.1.5 (Lion)       perfect
      * Microsoft Internet Explorer 9   perfect
      * Microsoft Internet Explorer 8   good
      * Microsoft Internet Explorer 7   minor problems
      * Microsoft Internet Explorer 6   not tested
      * KDE Konqueror 4.7.4             nonfunctional
      * KDE Konqueror 4.5.5             nonfunctional
      * Opera (all versions)            not tested

   NOTE: Internet Explorer 6 is no longer supported by JBrowse.

 * Added an automated-setup script, setup.sh, that tries to install
   Perl prerequisites, format Volvox example data, and install Wiggle
   and BAM support (fetching samtools from SVN if necessary)
   automatically.

 * Navigating to JBrowse with missing or malformed configuration or
   data will now bring up an error page with useful messages and links
   to help documentation, instead of a blank white page.

 * JBrowse data directories now include an Apache .htaccess in their
   root directory that, if mod_headers is installed and AllowOverride
   FileInfo or AllowOverride All is enabled, will emit the proper HTTP
   headers to allow cross-origin XHR requests for the data.

 * A new "Help" link in the upper right, or pressing "?" on the
   keyboard, brings up a "JBrowse Help" dialog box with basic usage
   information and links to more help information.

 * Arrowheads indicating strandedness are now drawn inside feature
   boundaries.

 * Clicking on the overview bar or the main scale bar now centers the
   view at the clicked position.  In addition, while holding down
   shift, clicking in the main track panel will also center the view
   at that position.

 * Added bin/remove-track.pl, a script to remove a track from a
   JBrowse data directory.  Run bin/remove-track.pl -? to see its
   documentation.

 * Added build instrumentation to support a JSDoc-based system of
   developer API documentation.  This documentation is still far from
   complete.

 * Ian Davis contributed code to add a view of the reverse strand of
   the sequence in the DNA track.  Thanks Ian!

 * Fixed bug in which, for some sequence chunk sizes, the DNA bases
   would display incorrectly.

 * Added minor gridlines to the main track view.

 * Fixed a long-standing off-by-one bug where the window could not be
   scrolled to view the last base in the reference sequence.

 * Coordinates displayed in the user interface are now 1-based closed
   coordinates, which are more familiar to most users.  Previously,
   the labels displayed interbase (i.e. 0-based half-open)
   coordinates.

 * NON-BACKWARDS-COMPATIBLE improvements to the JSON format used for
   track configuration, feature data, and image data
     - initial support for a new hook system for greater
       administrator-configurability of feature display
     - support for more than one level of subfeatures

 * Miscellaneous improvements and refactoring of data-formatting Perl
   code.

 * More detailed POD-based help documentation on all scripts

 * --tracklabel options to all scripts replaced with --trackLabel.

 * New suite of integration tests, and some unit tests, for
   server-side Perl code.

 * Beginnings of a suite of Selenium-based integration tests for the
   front-end JavaScript code.

 * Support for Apple touch-based devices merged into normal
   index.html, so that the same link can be used regardless of the
   browsing platform.

 * Bug fixed in which non-stranded features do not display properly
   (a problem with the CSS styles).

========================================================

version 1.2.1, March 2011

Fixed bugs in release 1.2:

- problems with BED handling reported by Gregg Helt and Brenton Graveley

- performance regression reported by Chris Childers

- incorrect handling of names in ucsc-to-json.pl

- wig2png slowdown reported by Brenton Graveley

========================================================

version 1.2, Febrary 2011

These notes document changes since release 1.1 in September 2010.

Most of the work in this release went into making JBrowse handle large
amounts of feature data better.  Before, the amount of memory used
when processing BAM files was more than 10 times the size of the file;
now, the amount of memory required is fixed.

Other new features in this release:

- Import of UCSC database dumps.  A ucsc-to-json.pl script is now
  provided for taking database dumps from UCSC and creating a JBrowse
  instance using them.  The "genePred" and "bed" track types are
  currently supported; "psl" tracks are not yet supported.

- Touch.  Juan Aguilar's code for using JBrowse on an iOS device
  (iPhone, iPod touch, iPad) is now integrated.  As of the current
  release, users wanting to use JBrowse on those devices have to
  navigate to a separate HTML page (touch.html) rather than the
  default index.html; i.e. the code does not currently detect
  touchscreen devices automatically.

- Bug fixes. A number of bugs have also been fixed, including one that
  restricted the placement of the "data" directory, and a bug in
  wiggle rendering that caused spurious peaks or troughs at tile
  boundaries.

Known issues/limitations with this release:

- Some additional CPAN modules are now required:

    PerlIO::gzip
    Heap::Simple
    Devel::Size

- No JSON-level backward compatibility. If you are upgrading from an
  older version of JBrowse, you will have to regenerate all the JSON
  files on your server. This means wiping your jbrowse/data directory
  and re-running all server scripts (flatfile-to-json, biodb-to-json,
  wig-to-json, etc.) to regenerate your data from the original
  FASTA/GFF/BED/WIG files. We apologize for the inconvenience of this,
  but it is inevitable sometimes; we do aim to minimize the number of
  releases which are backwardly-incompatible in this way.

========================================================

version 1.1, September 2010.

These notes document JBrowse developments in the period from July 2009
(online publication of the first JBrowse paper in Genome Research, the
de facto "version 1.0") up to September 2010 (the first in a planned
series of quarterly releases).

New features in this release:

- Scalability. JBrowse can now handle very large data tracks,
including human EST/SNP tracks, or tracks of next-gen sequence
reads. Large datasets are broken into smaller chunks, so there is no
loading delay for big tracks.

- Extensibility. A Perl module (ImageTrackRenderer.pm) for creating
user-drawn image tracks is now available, based on the CPAN GD.pm
module. An example program is provided, draw-basepair-track.pl, that
uses this module to draw arcs over a sequence representing the
base-pairing interactions of RNA secondary structure.

- Bug fixes. Numerous display glitches have been fixed, including
issues with wide-screen monitors and long mostly-offscreen features.

Known issues/limitations with this release:

- No JSON-level backward compatibility. If you are upgrading from an
older version of JBrowse, you will have to regenerate all the JSON
files on your server. This means wiping your jbrowse/data directory
and re-running all server scripts (flatfile-to-json, biodb-to-json,
wig-to-json, etc.) to regenerate your data from the original
FASTA/GFF/BED/WIG files.

- Next-gen sequence display is currently restricted to the
co-ordinates of the outermost region to which a single read is
mapped. There is no support (yet) for displaying pairing between
reads, sequences of reads, alignment of read to reference sequence
(e.g. splicing), or mismatches between read and reference.

- Processing SAM/BAM next-gen sequence files takes a lot of memory
(about 500 megabytes per million features).

- Numerical (as opposed to comparative) readout of the data in Wiggle
tracks, e.g. via a y-axis label or mouseover popup, is still
unsupported.
