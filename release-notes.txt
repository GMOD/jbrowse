 * Added support for "rubberband" dynamic zooming, in which users can
   click and drag to select a region to zoom to.  Dragging on any
   scale bar, or shift-dragging on the main track pane, triggers a
   dynamic zoom.

 * Correcting a long-standing oversight, wiggle data tracks and
   feature histograms now have numerical y-axis scales that show the
   numerical values of the data.

 * Server-side data-formatting scripts now support a --compress option
   to compress (gzip) feature and sequence data to conserve server
   disk space.  Using this option requires some web server
   configuration.  Under Apache, AllowOverride FileInfo (or
   AllowOverride All) must be set for the JBrowse data directories in
   order to use the included .htaccess files, and mod_headers and
   mod_setenvif must be installed and enabled.  Under nginx a
   configuration snippet like the following should be included in the
   configuration:

      location ~* "\.(json|txt)z$" {
               add_header Content-Encoding  gzip;
               gzip off;
               types { application/json jsonz; }
      }

 * flatfile-to-json.pl: now much faster and more memory-efficient,
   especially for GFF3 files.  Remember that '###' directives are very
   important to have in large GFF3 files!  Also removed nonfunctional
   --extraData switch.

 * Added ability to turn off some JBrowse UI panels via URL arguments
   to the default index.html, or via arguments to the Browser
   constructor itself.  Can dynamically turn off the navigation box,
   the overview panel, and the track list, respectively.  When all of
   these are off, and if run in an iframe, JBrowse is running in an
   "embedded mode" that looks similar to the output of GBrowse's
   gbrowse_img script, with the exception that the view in this case
   is a fully functioning, scrollable and zoomable JBrowse.  See the
   GMOD wiki (http://gmod.org/wiki/JBrowse) for more on how to set up
   embedded mode.  Thanks to Julie Moon, a co-op student working at
   OICR, for this work!

 * Improved graphical look and feel.

 * Browser support for this release:
      * Google Chrome 18                perfect
      * Google Chrome 17                perfect
      * Mozilla Firefox 11.0            perfect
      * Mozilla Firefox 10.1            perfect
      * Mozilla Firefox 10.0.2          perfect
      * Mozilla Firefox 3.6.28          nonfunctional
      * Apple Safari 5.1.5 (Lion)       perfect
      * Microsoft Internet Explorer 9   perfect
      * Microsoft Internet Explorer 8   good
      * Microsoft Internet Explorer 7   minor problems
      * Microsoft Internet Explorer 6   not tested
      * KDE Konqueror 4.7.4             nonfunctional
      * KDE Konqueror 4.5.5             nonfunctional
      * Opera (all versions)            not tested

   NOTE: Internet Explorer 6 is no longer supported by JBrowse.

 * Added an automated-setup script, setup.sh, that tries to install
   Perl prerequisites, format Volvox example data, and install Wiggle
   and BAM support (fetching samtools from SVN if necessary)
   automatically.

 * Navigating to JBrowse with missing or malformed configuration or
   data will now bring up an error page with useful messages and links
   to help documentation, instead of a blank white page.

 * JBrowse data directories now include an Apache .htaccess in their
   root directory that, if mod_headers is installed and AllowOverride
   FileInfo or AllowOverride All is enabled, will emit the proper HTTP
   headers to allow cross-origin XHR requests for the data.

 * A new "Help" link in the upper right, or pressing "?" on the
   keyboard, brings up a "JBrowse Help" dialog box with basic usage
   information and links to more help information.

 * Arrowheads indicating strandedness are now drawn inside feature
   boundaries.

 * Clicking on the overview bar or the main scale bar now centers the
   view at the clicked position.  In addition, while holding down
   shift, clicking in the main track panel will also center the view
   at that position.

 * Added bin/remove-track.pl, a script to remove a track from a
   JBrowse data directory.  Run bin/remove-track.pl -? to see its
   documentation.

 * Added build instrumentation to support a JSDoc-based system of
   developer API documentation.  This documentation is still far from
   complete.

 * Ian Davis contributed code to add a view of the reverse strand of
   the sequence in the DNA track.  Thanks Ian!

 * Fixed bug in which, for some sequence chunk sizes, the DNA bases
   would display incorrectly.

 * Added minor gridlines to the main track view.

 * Fixed a long-standing off-by-one bug where the window could not be
   scrolled to view the last base in the reference sequence.

 * Coordinates displayed in the user interface are now 1-based closed
   coordinates, which are more familiar to most users.  Previously,
   the labels displayed interbase (i.e. 0-based half-open)
   coordinates.

 * NON-BACKWARDS-COMPATIBLE improvements to the JSON format used for
   track configuration, feature data, and image data
     - initial support for a new hook system for greater
       administrator-configurability of feature display
     - support for more than one level of subfeatures

 * Miscellaneous improvements and refactoring of data-formatting Perl
   code.

 * More detailed POD-based help documentation on all scripts

 * --tracklabel options to all scripts replaced with --trackLabel.

 * New suite of integration tests, and some unit tests, for
   server-side Perl code.

 * Beginnings of a suite of Selenium-based integration tests for the
   front-end JavaScript code.

 * Support for Apple touch-based devices merged into normal
   index.html, so that the same link can be used regardless of the
   browsing platform.

 * Bug fixed in which non-stranded features do not display properly
   (a problem with the CSS styles).

========================================================

version 1.2.1, March 2011

Fixed bugs in release 1.2:

- problems with BED handling reported by Gregg Helt and Brenton Graveley

- performance regression reported by Chris Childers

- incorrect handling of names in ucsc-to-json.pl

- wig2png slowdown reported by Brenton Graveley

========================================================

version 1.2, Febrary 2011

These notes document changes since release 1.1 in September 2010.

Most of the work in this release went into making JBrowse handle large
amounts of feature data better.  Before, the amount of memory used
when processing BAM files was more than 10 times the size of the file;
now, the amount of memory required is fixed.

Other new features in this release:

- Import of UCSC database dumps.  A ucsc-to-json.pl script is now
  provided for taking database dumps from UCSC and creating a JBrowse
  instance using them.  The "genePred" and "bed" track types are
  currently supported; "psl" tracks are not yet supported.

- Touch.  Juan Aguilar's code for using JBrowse on an iOS device
  (iPhone, iPod touch, iPad) is now integrated.  As of the current
  release, users wanting to use JBrowse on those devices have to
  navigate to a separate HTML page (touch.html) rather than the
  default index.html; i.e. the code does not currently detect
  touchscreen devices automatically.

- Bug fixes. A number of bugs have also been fixed, including one that
  restricted the placement of the "data" directory, and a bug in
  wiggle rendering that caused spurious peaks or troughs at tile
  boundaries.

Known issues/limitations with this release:

- Some additional CPAN modules are now required:

    PerlIO::gzip
    Heap::Simple
    Devel::Size

- No JSON-level backward compatibility. If you are upgrading from an
  older version of JBrowse, you will have to regenerate all the JSON
  files on your server. This means wiping your jbrowse/data directory
  and re-running all server scripts (flatfile-to-json, biodb-to-json,
  wig-to-json, etc.) to regenerate your data from the original
  FASTA/GFF/BED/WIG files. We apologize for the inconvenience of this,
  but it is inevitable sometimes; we do aim to minimize the number of
  releases which are backwardly-incompatible in this way.

========================================================

version 1.1, September 2010.

These notes document JBrowse developments in the period from July 2009
(online publication of the first JBrowse paper in Genome Research, the
de facto "version 1.0") up to September 2010 (the first in a planned
series of quarterly releases).

New features in this release:

- Scalability. JBrowse can now handle very large data tracks,
including human EST/SNP tracks, or tracks of next-gen sequence
reads. Large datasets are broken into smaller chunks, so there is no
loading delay for big tracks.

- Extensibility. A Perl module (ImageTrackRenderer.pm) for creating
user-drawn image tracks is now available, based on the CPAN GD.pm
module. An example program is provided, draw-basepair-track.pl, that
uses this module to draw arcs over a sequence representing the
base-pairing interactions of RNA secondary structure.

- Bug fixes. Numerous display glitches have been fixed, including
issues with wide-screen monitors and long mostly-offscreen features.

Known issues/limitations with this release:

- No JSON-level backward compatibility. If you are upgrading from an
older version of JBrowse, you will have to regenerate all the JSON
files on your server. This means wiping your jbrowse/data directory
and re-running all server scripts (flatfile-to-json, biodb-to-json,
wig-to-json, etc.) to regenerate your data from the original
FASTA/GFF/BED/WIG files.

- Next-gen sequence display is currently restricted to the
co-ordinates of the outermost region to which a single read is
mapped. There is no support (yet) for displaying pairing between
reads, sequences of reads, alignment of read to reference sequence
(e.g. splicing), or mismatches between read and reference.

- Processing SAM/BAM next-gen sequence files takes a lot of memory
(about 500 megabytes per million features).

- Numerical (as opposed to comparative) readout of the data in Wiggle
tracks, e.g. via a y-axis label or mouseover popup, is still
unsupported.
