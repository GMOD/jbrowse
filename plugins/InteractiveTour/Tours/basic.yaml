        Welcome to JBrowse!

        JBrowse is an interactive Genome Browser. It's completely
        self-contained inside your web browser and incredibly fast.

        This is a quick tutorial to help you familiarize yourself with
        JBrowse's functionality

        <hr style="width:100%"/>
        <b>NB:</b> This tutorial is optimised for the Volvox sample data that
        ships with JBrowse. If you are not there already, you can
        <a href="?data=sample_data%2Fjson%2Fvolvox">attempt to access it</a>.

    title: Genome Movement
    node: dijit_layout_ContentPane_0
    message: |
        This is the genome movement area. It features controls which allow
        you to move about the genome.

    title: "Genome Movement: Coarse Genome Position"
    node: overview
    message: |
        On the top bar you see the numbered track with a red box. This
        indicates your position along the genome.

        <ul>
            <li>Click to move to a position</li>
            <li>Click + Drag to select a specific region to zoom in on</li>
        </ul>

        Try clicking anywhere on the bar to navigate to that position.
    requireInteraction:
        type: click
        targets:
            - overview

    title: "Genome Movement: Navigation menu"
    node: navbox
    message: |
        Below the position bar, is the motion menu. 
-
    title: "Genome Movement: Left &amp; Right"
    node: moveLeft
    message: |
        The left and right buttons allow you to navigate "page by page"
        through the genome.

        Click left or right to continue.
    requireInteraction:
        type: click
        targets:
            - moveLeft
            - moveRight

    title: "Genome Movement: Zooming"
    node: bigZoomOut
    message: |
        The larger magnifying glasses zoom a large
        interval in and out. The small ones only zoom a little bit at a time.
    requireInteraction:
        type: click
        targets:
            - bigZoomOut
            - zoomOut
            - zoomIn
            - bigZoomIn

    title: "Genome Movement: Location"
    node: location-info
    message: |
        Next is your location string. This tells you which contig/chromosome
        you are viewing, and what the base position is.
-
    title: "Genome Movement: Highlighter"
    node: highlight-btn
    message: |
        The highlighter lets you highlight a region of the genome. This is
        useful for marking areas of interest and specifying an area when
        sharing a JBrowse link with a colleague.
-
    title: "Genome Movement: Chromosome Selection"
    node: search-refseq
    message: |
        On the right hand side is the contig/chromosome selector. Clicking
        this dropdown will let you jump to another contig. 
-
    title: "Genome Movement: Search"
    node: widget_location
    message: |
        To the right of it is a search box for searching the genome data.
        Simply enter a string and find matching features.

        #Try it by clicking the search box and entering the string <code>EDEN.1</code>.
        #Once you've done that, hit "Go".
    #requireInteractions:
        #-
            #type: click
            #targets:
                #- widget_location
        #-
            #type: dataValue
            #target: "#widget_location input#location"
            #expectedContents: "EDEN.1"
        #-
            #type: click
            #targets:
                #- search-go-btn

    title: "Genome Movement: Fine Genome Position"
    node: static_track
    message: |
        Lastly for the genome movement bar is the fine grained genome position.

        This behaves identically to the coarse grain position bar:
        <ul>
            <li>Click to move to a position</li>
            <li>Click + Drag to select a specific region to zoom in on</li>
        </ul>

    title: "Tracks"
    node: hierarchicalTrackPane
    message: |
        JBrowse and GBrowse both feature the concept of "tracks" of data which
        can be turned on and off to help you gain genomic context for your
        annotation and browsing. These tracks are visible on the left hand
        menu.
