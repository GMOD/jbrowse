        Welcome to JBrowse!

        JBrowse is an interactive Genome Browser. It's completely
        self-contained inside your web browser and incredibly fast.

        This is a quick tutorial to help you familiarize yourself with
        JBrowse's functionality

    title: Genome Movement
    node: dijit_layout_ContentPane_0
    message: |
        This is the genome movement area. It features controls which allow
        you to move about the genome.

    title: "Genome Movement: Coarse Genome Position"
    node: overview
    message: |
        On the top bar you see the numbered track with a red box. This
        indicates your position along the genome.

        <ul>
            <li>Click to move to a position</li>
            <li>Click + Drag to select a specific region to zoom in on</li>
        </ul>

    title: "Genome Movement: Navigation menu"
    node: navbox
    message: |
        Below the position bar, is the motion menu. 
-
    title: "Genome Movement: Left &amp; Right"
    node: moveLeft
    message: |
        The left and right buttons allow you to navigate "page by page"
        through the genome. 
-
    title: "Genome Movement: Zooming"
    node: bigZoomOut
    message: |
        The larger magnifying glasses zoom a large
        interval in and out. The small ones only zoom a little bit at a time.
-
    title: "Genome Movement: Location"
    node: location-info
    message: |
        Next is your location string. This tells you which contig/chromosome
        you are viewing, and what the base position is.
-
    title: "Genome Movement: Highlighter"
    node: highlight-btn
    message: |
        The highlighter lets you highlight a region of the genome. This is
        useful for marking areas of interest and specifying an area when
        sharing a JBrowse link with a colleague.
-
    title: "Genome Movement: Chromosome Selection"
    node: search-refseq
    message: |
        On the right hand side is the contig/chromosome selector. Clicking
        this dropdown will let you jump to another contig. 
-
    title: "Genome Movement: Search"
    node: widget_location
    message: |
        To the right of it is a search box for searching the genome data.
        Simply enter a string and find matching features.
-
    title: "Genome Movement: Fine Genome Position"
    node: static_track
    message: |
        Lastly for the genome movement bar is the fine grained genome position.

        This behaves identically to the coarse grain position bar:
        <ul>
            <li>Click to move to a position</li>
            <li>Click + Drag to select a specific region to zoom in on</li>
        </ul>
