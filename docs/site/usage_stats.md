# Anonymous Usage Statistics

By default, JBrowse instances report usage statistics to the JBrowse developers.
This data is very important to the JBrowse project, since it is used to make the
case to grant agencies for continuing to fund JBrowse development. No research
data is transmitted, the data collected is limited to standard Google Analytics,
along with a count of how many tracks the JBrowse instance has, how many
reference sequences are present, their average length, and what types of tracks
(wiggle, feature, etc) are present. Users can disable usage statistics by
setting `suppressUsageStatistics: true` in the JBrowse configuration.
