# Pre-rendered Image Tracks

JBrowse supports tracks based on pre-generated PNG or JPEG images that are tiled along the reference sequence. Currently, JBrowse ships with two different image track generators: [wig-to-json.pl](#wig-to-jsonpl "wikilink"), which generates images showing simple quantitative (wiggle) data, and [draw-basepair-track.pl](#draw-basepair-trackpl "wikilink"), which draws arcs to show the base pairing structure of RNAs.

## wig-to-json.pl

Using a [wiggle](http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/wiggle.html) file, this script creates a single Image track that displays data from the wiggle file. **Beginning with JBrowse 1.5, this is no longer the recommended method of displaying wiggle data: it has largely been replaced by the direct-access BigWig data store coupled with the next-generation Wiggle track type. See [Wiggle Tracks](</#Wiggle/BigWig_Tracks_(XYPlot,_Density)> "wikilink").**

In wiggle data, a numeric value is associated with each nucleotide position in the reference sequence. This is represented in JBrowse as a track that looks like a histogram, where the horizontal axis is for each nucleotide position, and the vertical axis is for the number associated with that position. The vertical axis currently does not have a scale; rather, the heights for each position are relative to each other.

Special dependencies: [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)

In order to use wig-to-json.pl, the code for wig2png must be compiled. Normally, this is done automatically by `setup.sh` but it can be done manually if necessary. See the Quick Start Tutorial packaged with JBrowse for details.

### Basic usage

`bin/wig-to-json.pl --wig <wig file> --tracklabel <track name> [options]`

Hint: If you are using this type of track to plot a measure of a prediction's quality, where the range of possible quality scores is from some lowerbound to some upperbound (for instance, between 0 and 1), you can specify these bounds with the max and min options.

| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| wig        | The name of the wig file that will be used. This option must be specified.                                                                                                      |
| tracklabel | The internal name that JBrowse will give to this feature track. This option requires a value.                                                                                   |

| out        | A path to the output directory (default is 'data' in the current directory).                                                                                                    |

### System-specific tips for building wig2png

#### Apple OS X

You need libpng and a C++ compiler; you can get these with [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/), or [Fink](http://www.finkproject.org/).

Once you have those installed, you need to compile the JBrowse wiggle-processing program. JBrowse includes a makefile to do this, but you may need to add the paths for `libpng` and `png.h` to your compiler's library and include paths. For example, if libpng is in `/usr/X11`, you can run `configure` like this:

`./configure CXXFLAGS=-I/usr/X11/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/X11/lib`

Depending on which OS X you have (and whether you're using MacPorts/fink/etc.), libpng might be somewhere other than `/usr/X11`, like `/opt/local` for example. To find where libpng is, try `locate libpng`.

#### Ubuntu / Debian Linux

Be sure to install the `libpng\#\#` and `libpng\#\#-dev` packages, where `\#\#` is a number such as 12 or 15, depending on the version of Ubuntu.

#### Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora Linux

Be sure to install the `libpng` and `libpng-devel` packages.

# # draw-basepair-track.pl

This script inputs a single base pairing track into JBrowse. A base pairing track is a distinctive track type that represents base pairing between nucleotides as arcs. In addition, it is intended to demonstrate the Perl API for writing your own image track generators.

### Basic usage

`bin/draw-basepair-track.pl --gff <gff file> --tracklabel <track name> [options]`
