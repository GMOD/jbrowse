JBrowse's default index.html file provides a number of options for changing the
current view in the browser by adding query parameters to the URL. Developers'
note: these URL parameters are handled only in the default index.html that ships
with JBrowse; the JBrowse code itself does not pay attention to URL parameters.

Basic syntax:

```
http://<server>/<path to jbrowse>?loc=<location string>&tracks=<tracks to show>
```

## data

Optional relative (or absolute) URL of the base directory from which JBrowse
will load data. Defaults to 'data'.

## loc

The initial genomic position which will be visible in the viewing field.
Possible input strings are:

**"Chromosome"+":"+ start point + ".." + end point**

A chromosome name/ID followed by “:”, starting position, “..” and end position
of the genome to be viewed in the browser is used as an input. Chromosome ID can
be either a string or a mix of string and numbers. “CHR” to indicate chromosome
may or may not be used. Strings are not case-sensitive. If the chromosome ID is
found in the database reference sequence (RefSeq), the chromosome will be shown
from the starting position to the end position given in URL.

`example) ctgA:100..200`
`Chromosome ctgA will be displayed from position 100 to 200.`

OR **start point + ".." + end point**

A string of numerical value, “..” and another numerical value is given with the
loc option. JBrowse navigates through the currently selected chromosome from the
first numerical value, start point, to the second numerical value, end point.

`example) 200..600`

OR **center base**

If only one numerical value is given as an input, JBrowse treats the input as
the center position. Then an arbitrary region of the currently selected gene is
displayed in the viewing field with the given input position as basepair
position on which to center the view.

OR **feature name/ID**

If a string or a mix of string and numbers are entered as an input, JBrowser
treats the input as a feature name/ID of a gene. If the ID exists in the
database RefSeq, JBrowser displays an arbitrary region of the feature from the
the position 0, starting position of the gene, to a certain end point.

`example) ctgA`

## tracks

parameters are comma-delimited strings containing track names, each of which
should correspond to the "label" element of the track information dictionaries
that are currently viewed in the viewing field. Names for the tracks can be
found in data/trackInfo.js in jbrowse-1.2.1 folder.

Example:

`tracks=DNA,knownGene,ccdsGene,snp131,pgWatson,simpleRepeat`

## highlight

Location string that specifies the genomic position to highlight. The location
string must follow the format of chromosome name/ID followed by “:”, starting
position, “..” and end position.

`[chromosome]:[start]..[end]`

Example:

`highlight=ctgA:100..200`

This is the only format that is currently supported.

## addFeatures

Available in JBrowse 1.10.0 and above. This variable accepts feature data in
JSON format in the form:

`[{ "seq_id":"ctgA", "start": 123, "end": 456, "name": "MyBLASTHit"},...}]`

which, when URI-escaped and put in the query string, looks like:

`addFeatures=%5B%7B%20%22seq_id%22%3A%22ctgA%22%2C%20%22start%22%3A%20123%2C%20%22end%22%3A%20456%2C%20%22name%22%3A%20%22MyBLASTHit%22%7D%5D`

in dot-notation, the second number is the order of the feature object in the
JSONArray:

`addFeatures.<featurenumber>.<values>`

e.g.

`addFeatures.1.seq_id=ctgA&addFeatures.1.start=123&addFeatures.1.start=456&addFeatures.1.name=MyBLASTHit&addFeatures.2.seq_id=...`

Developers integrating JBrowse into larger project may find this feature useful
for displaying results from other non-JavaScript-based applications (such as web
BLAST tools) in JBrowse.

Features added to JBrowse in this way are available in a special data store
named `url`, which can be specified in a track configuration by adding
`"store":"url"`.

## addTracks

This variable accepts track configurations in JSON format to be added to the
tracks already in the JBrowse configuration, in the form:

`[{"label":"mytrack","type":"JBrowse/View/Track/HTMLFeatures","store":"myUniqueStore"}]`

which, when URI-escaped and put in the query string, looks like:

`addTracks=%5B%7B%22label%22%3A%22mytrack%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22JBrowse%2FView%2FTrack%2FHTMLFeatures%22%2C%22store%22%3A%22myUniqueStore%22%7D%5D`

using [dot notation](https://github.com/rhalff/dot-object). See
release-notes.txt for more details:

`addTracks.myUniqueStore.label=mytrack&addTracks.myUniqueStore.myUniqueStore.type=JBrowse/View/Track/HTMLFeatures`

If you are not adding a store, make the store name 'none'
(addTracks.none.label).

## addStores

This variable accepts store configurations in JSON format to be added to the
stores already in the JBrowse configuration, in the form:

```
   { "uniqueStoreName": {
         "type":"JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/GFF3",
         "urlTemplate": "url/of/my/file.gff3"
     }
   }
```

which, when URI-escaped and put in the query string, looks like:

`addStores=%7B%22uniqueStoreName%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22JBrowse%2FStore%2FSeqFeature%2FGFF3%22%2C%22urlTemplate%22%3A%22url%2Fof%2Fmy%2Ffile.gff3%22%7D%7D`

using [dot notation](https://github.com/rhalff/dot-object). See
release-notes.txt for more details:

`addStores.uniqueStoreName.type=JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/GFF3&addStores.uniqueStoreName.urlTemplate=url/of/my/file.gff3`

One example is to use addStores combined with addTracks to dynamically load a
remote file. Thanks to vkrishna for the example

`addStores={"url":{"type":"JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/GFF3","urlTemplate":"http://host/genes.gff"}}&addTracks=[{"label":"genes","type":"JBrowse/View/Track/CanvasFeatures","store":"url"}]`

Another example if you want to not provide the entire URL to the store (e.g.
provide a path relative to data directory instead of http://host/genes.gff) is
to use a combination of the baseUrl and the {dataRoot} variables. This example
adds a VCF track:

`addStores={"mystore":{"type":"JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/VCFTabix","baseUrl":".","urlTemplate":"{dataRoot}/combined.vcf.gz"}}&addTracks=[{"label":"variants","type":"JBrowse/View/Track/CanvasVariants","store":"mystore"}]`

In dot-notation:

`addStores.mystore.type=JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/VCFTabix&addStores.mystore.baseUrl=.&addStores.mystore.urlTemplate="{dataRoot}/combined.vcf.gz"&addTracks.mystore.label=variants&addTracks.mystore.type=Browse/View/Track/CanvasVariants`

Thanks to biojiangke for inquiring about the above example.

## addBookmarks

Bookmarks are available in JBrowse starting in 1.12.2, which allows you to add
static coloured overlays to specific regions of the genome.

This variable accepts [track bookmarks](#bookmarking-regions 'wikilink')
(similar to highlights) in JSON format to be added to the tracks already in the
JBrowse configuration, in the form:

`[{"start":5500,"end":6000,"color": "rgba(190,50,50,0.5)","ref": "ctgB"}]`

which, when URI-escaped and put in the query string, looks like:

`addBookmarks=%5B%7B%22start%22%3A5500%2C%22end%22%3A6000%2C%22color%22%3A%20%22rgba(190%2C50%2C50%2C0.5)%22%2C%22ref%22%3A%20%22ctgB%22%7D%5D`

using [dot notation](https://github.com/rhalff/dot-object). See
release-notes.txt for more details:

`addBookmarks.start=5500&addBookmarks.end=6000&addBookmarks.color="rgba(190,50,50,0.5)"&addBookmarks.ref=ctgB`

Bookmarks can also be manually added to the configuration, e.g. tracks.conf:

```
   [ bookmarks ]
   features+= json:{"start":5000,"end":5750,"color": "rgba(190,50,50,0.5)","ref": "ctgB"}
   features+= json:{"start":5500,"end":6000,"color": "rgba(190,50,50,0.5)","ref": "ctgB"}
```

They can also be retrieved from a remote "bookmark API", which receives a query
parameter "sequence" for the current refseq and returns data in the JSON format
similar to above

`bookmarkService=http://yourbookmarkservice.com/jbrowseBookmark`

An example appears in the Volvox example, on ctgB.

# Embedded mode

JBrowse's included `index.html` file supports three URL query arguments that can
turn off the JBrowse track list, navigation bar, and overview bar, respectively.
When all three of these are turned off, the only thing visible are the displayed
tracks themselves, and JBrowse could be said to be running in a kind of
"embedded mode".

The three parameters used for this are `nav`, `tracklist`, `menu` and
`overview`. If any of these are set to 0, that part of the JBrowse interface is
hidden.

For example, you could put the embedded-mode JBrowse in an iframe, like this:

```
<html>
<head>
<title>
JBrowse Embedded

</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>
Embedded Volvox JBrowse

</h1>
<div style="width: 400px; margin: 0 auto;">
       <iframe style="border: 1px solid black" src="../../index.html?data=sample_data/json/volvox&tracklist=0&nav=0&overview=0&tracks=DNA%2CExampleFeatures%2CNameTest%2CMotifs%2CAlignments%2CGenes%2CReadingFrame%2CCDS%2CTranscript%2CClones%2CEST" width="300" height="300">
       </iframe>

</div>
</body>
</html>
```

Note that if you are embedding with an iframe, it can be useful to keep the
functionality that jbrowse has to update the URL bar in the parent frame. See
this FAQ entry for details
