Starting with version 1.7.0, JBrowse users can export track data in a variety of formats for either specific regions, or for entire reference sequences. Export functionality can also be limited and disabled on a per-track basis using the configuration variables listed below.

## Data Formats

Current supported export data formats are:

-   FASTA (sequence tracks)
-   GFF3 (all tracks)
-   bed (feature and alignment tracks)
-   bedGraph (wiggle tracks)
-   Wiggle (wiggle tracks)

## Export Configuration

Each track in JBrowse that can export data supports the following configuration variables.

| Option                              | Value                                                                                                                                             |
