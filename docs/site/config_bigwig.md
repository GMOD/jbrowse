title: Wiggle/BigWig Tracks
---

JBrowse offers two available subtypes of Wiggle tracks, `Wiggle/XYPlot` and `Wiggle/Density`. The XYPlot wiggle track displays quantitative data as an x/y plot, and the Density displays the data as varying intensities of color.

      {
         "label"         : "rnaseq",
         "key"           : "RNA-Seq Coverage",
         "storeClass"    : "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/BigWig",
         "urlTemplate"   : "../tests/data/SL2.40_all_rna_seq.v1.bigwig",
         "type"          : "JBrowse/View/Track/Wiggle/XYPlot",
         "variance_band" : true,
         "min_score"     : -1000,
         "max_score"     : 2000,
         "style": {
             "pos_color"         : "#FFA600",

## Example BigWig-based Wiggle Color Density Track Configuration

Here is an example track configuration stanza for a Wiggle color-density track displaying data directly from a [BigWig file](http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format6.1). It will draw regions with data that is greater than the overall mean as progressively more intense blue, and data that is below the mean as progressively more intense red. Note that the URL in `urlTemplate` is relative to the directory where the configuration file is located.

      {
         "label"         : "rnaseq",
         "key"           : "RNA-Seq Coverage",
         "storeClass"    : "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/BigWig",
         "urlTemplate"   : "my_methylation_data.bw",
         "type"          : "JBrowse/View/Track/Wiggle/Density",
         "bicolor_pivot" : "mean",
         "style": {
             "pos_color": "purple",
             "neg_color": "green"
         }
      }

| `yScalePosition`          | Position of the y-axis scale indicator when the track is zoomed far enough out that density histograms are displayed. Can be "left", "right", or "center". Defaults to "center".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `origin_color`            | Added in JBrowse 1.7.1, sets the color of the graph origin line in wiggle XY plots. If set to 'none', turns the origin line off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `bg_color`                | Added in JBrowse 1.7.0, sets the background color for each point at which data is present. Wiggle/Density tracks blend the background color with the pos_color or neg_color to select a color for the region, whereas Wiggle/XYPlot tracks draw the background color on the part of the graph for each data point that is not covered by the pos_color or neg_color. Defaults to transparent for XYPlots, and light gray for Density tracks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `scale`                   | `linear,log` default `linear` Graphing scale, either linear or logarithmic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `min_score`               | Number. The minimum value to be graphed. Calculated according to **autoscale** if not provided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `max_score`               | Number. The maximum value to be graphed. Calculated according to **autoscale** if not provided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `autoscale`               | `local,clipped_global,global,z_score` If one or more of `min_score` and `max_score` options are absent, then these values will be calculated automatically. The `autoscale` option controls how the calculation is done. A value of `local` (only available and set as the default in JBrowse 1.9.0 and above) sets the display scale to fit the range of the data being displayed in the current viewing window. A value of `global` will use global statistics (if available) for the entire quantitative dataset to find min_score and max_score values. `z_score` will use either ±`z_score_bound` if it is set, or will use ±4 otherwise. `clipped_global` is similar to `global`, except the bounds will be limited to ±`z_score_bound`, or ±4 if `z_score_bound` is not set. |
| `variance_band`           | `1 or 0` If 1, draw a yellow line showing the mean, and two shaded bands showing ±1 and ±2 standard deviations from the mean.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `z_score_bound`           | for z-score based graphs, the bounds to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `data_offset`             | number, default zero. If set, will offset the data display by the given value. For example, a `data_offset` of -100 would make a data value of 123 be displayed as 23, and a `data_offset` of 100 would make 123 be displayed as 223.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## BigWig File Compatibility

At least one user has reported that BigWig files generated with older versions of Jim Kent's wigToBigWig tool are not compatible with JBrowse. If you encounter difficulties opening a BigWig file, try regenerating it with a more recent version of wigToBigWig, and reporting the problem to the mailing list.
