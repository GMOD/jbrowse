CanvasFeatures are an alternative to HTMLFeatures and display features on the
genome, including genes using HTML5 canvases. They are faster than HTML features
and are somewhat easier to configure since it can be done in the config instead
of via CSS styling.

The flatfile-to-json.pl by can output CanvasFeatures using the --trackType
CanvasFeatures option

For more info on loading with flatfile-to-json.pl see
the[flatfile-to-json.pl](flatfile-to-json.pl.html) docs.

## CanvasFeatures Configuration Options

Introduced in JBrowse 1.10.0, the new JBrowse CanvasFeatures tracks are faster
and easier to configure than HTMLFeatures tracks.

| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `maxHeight`                        | Maximum height, in pixels, that the track is allowed to grow to. When it reaches this height, features that stack higher than this will not be shown, and a "Max height reached" message will be displayed. Default 600 pixels.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `style→showLabels`                 | If true, allows feature labels to be shown if features are not too dense on the screen. Default `true`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `style→featureScale`               | Minimum zoom scale (pixels/basepair) for displaying individual features in the track. Not set by default, and overrides the `maxFeatureScreenDensity`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `maxFeatureScreenDensity`          | Maximum density of features to display on the screen. If this is exceeded, will display either feature density histograms (if available), or a "too many features to show" or "too much data to show" message. The units of this number are features per screen width in pixels. Defaults to 0.5. If increased to \~6 then it should pretty much always go away                                                             |
| `glyph`                            | JS class name of the glyph to use for each feature. By default, it tries to guess for each feature based on its `type` attribute, and uses JBrowse/View/FeatureGlyph/Box if it cannot find something better. Can be a callback with signature (feature), returning a string class name.                                                                                                                                     |
| `menuTemplate`                     | Optional menu configuration for right-click menus on features. Can be as large and complicated as you want. See [Right-click_Context_Menus](#right-click-context-menus 'wikilink') below. If set to null or false, disables feature right-click menus.                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `style→color`                      | Basic color of features. Most glyphs interpret this as the fill color of the rectangle they draw. Color syntax is the same as that used for CSS, specified at <http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-color/>. Default 'goldenrod'.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `style→utrColor`                   | Color of UTR regions drawn by ProcessedTranscript and Gene glyphs. Color syntax is the same as that used for CSS, specified at <http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-color/>. Defaults to be a color that complements the current `style→color` value (calculated using a bit of color theory).                                                                                                                                      |

| `transcriptType`                   | For Gene glyphs, the feature `type` tag that indicates that a subfeature is a processed transcript. Defaults to 'mRNA'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `labelTranscripts`                 | For Gene glyphs, if true, draw a label with the transcript's name beside each transcript, if space permits. Default true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `style→transcriptLabelFont`        | For Gene glyphs, the font used for transcript name labels. Same format as CSS font rules. Default 'normal 10px Univers,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

If true, indicates that UTRs are not present in the feature data, but should be inferred from the overlap of exon and CDS features in ProcessedTranscript and Gene glyphs. Default false. Can be a callback.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `maxFeatureGlyphExpansion`         | A factor to expand the glyphs by so that if subfeatures go outside the bounds of the parent feature, they will still be rendered. Default: 500bp/current scale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `inferCdsParts`                    | If a single CDS span covers the whole gene except the UTRs, then it is drawn as though it only covers the exon parts (not the introns). Default: false. Added in 1.12.3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `disableCollapsedClick`            | Disables the click action when track is collapsed. Default: false. Added in 1.13.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `enableCollapsedMouseover`         | Enables the mouseover action when track is collapsed. Default: false. Added in 1.13.0. See the ChromHMM track in volvox sample browser for example of mouseover on the collapsed track                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `topLevelFeatures`                 | Specifies which feature types should be considered "top-level" for this track. For example, if you have a track with gene-\>mRNA-\>CDS features, but for some reason want to only display the mRNA features, you can set topLevelFeatures=mRNA. Can also be an array of string types, or a function callback that returns an array of types. Default: all features are displayed. Added in 1.14.0                           |
| `topLevelFeaturesPercent`          | Approximate percentage of features in the store that are top-level. Used to correct feature statistics estimates, which are used by JBrowse to decide when to display feature labels, and when to show feature density histograms. For example, topLevelFeaturesPercent=10 would say that only about 10% of features in the store are top-level, so adjust statistics estimates accordingly. Default 100, adding in 1.15.4. |
| `ItemRgb`                          | If set to true, the RGB colors specified in BigBed or BED files will be used for the feature's background color. Default true.

| `style→unprocessedTranscriptColor` | A color for the unprocessed transcript glyph. This is used when there is a mix of coding and non-coding transcripts in your GFF                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `noncodingType`                    | An array of non-coding feature types from column 3 of your GFF, default: ['ncRNA', 'lnc_RNA', 'lncRNA', 'miRNA']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Note: the "compact" displayMode for CanvasFeatures tracks uses style-\>height
and multiplies it by 0.35 to create the compact view. Therefore, if you adjust
style-\>height to a smaller default value, then you can create "ultra compact"
visualizations.

### Customizing CanvasFeatures tracks with callbacks

Unlike HTML-based feature tracks, canvas-based feature tracks don't use modify
and create hooks. Instead, the `glyph` variable, and all of the `style`
variables, support customization callbacks.
