Changes in this release:

*   Fixed feature-layout performance problem when zoomed very far in
on features that are much larger than the viewing window.

*   Added a default `menuTemplate` to all HTML-based features, so that
all HTML features now have a right-click menu by default.

*   Add `css` configuration variable that allows users to specify
either strings or URLs containing CSS to add.

*   improved `bin/ucsc-to-json.pl` error messages

*   `bin/add-track-json.pl` now replaces tracks in the target
configuration if they have the same label.
