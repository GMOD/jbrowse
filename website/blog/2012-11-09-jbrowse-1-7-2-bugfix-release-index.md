JBrowse 1.7.2 has been released, containing a fix for some further BAM issues found in the [1.7.1 release](https://jbrowse.org/jbrowse-1-7-1-bugfix-release/ "JBrowse 1.7.1 bugfix release"). Thanks so much to everyone who has worked with me to isolate problems in JBrowse's BAM support. The more people report problems, the more bulletproof the BAM backend gets.
