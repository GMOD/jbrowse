JBrowse 1.6.4 has been released, containing fixes for some small issues in the [1.6.3 release](https://jbrowse.org/jbrowse-1-6-3-bugfix-release/ "JBrowse 1.6.3 bugfix release").

Files for download:

-   [JBrowse-1.6.4-min.zip](https://jbrowse.org/releases/JBrowse-1.6.4-min.zip) - 2.8M
-   [JBrowse-1.6.4-full.zip](https://jbrowse.org/releases/JBrowse-1.6.4-full.zip) - 27.3M
    Changes in this release:

-   Improvements to the scalability of `generate-names.pl`. Many
    thanks to Steffi Geisen for her ongoing help with this.

        *   Users can now manually specify which tracks will be indexed to

    enable autocompletion and searching for their feature names in
    the JBrowse location box. \* The lazy-trie name indexing structure now correctly handles the
    case of large numbers of features that may share the same
    name. Before, it was generating files that were too large for
    the client to handle.

-   Fixed off-by-one error in Wiggle track display code: wiggle data
    was incorrectly displayed shifted one base to the left of its
    proper position. Thanks to Steffi Geisen for noticing this.
-   Fixed bug in which the reference-sequence selection box did not
    automatically update in all situations to reflect the current
    reference sequence.
