JBrowse 1.4.1 has been released, containing some small fixes for issues in the [1.4.0 release](https://jbrowse.org/jbrowse-1-4-0-released-includes-faceted-track-selection/ "JBrowse 1.4.0 released, includes faceted track selection!").

-   [JBrowse-1.4.1-min.zip](https://jbrowse.org/releases/JBrowse-1.4.1-min.zip) - 2.6M
-   [JBrowse-1.4.1-full.zip](https://jbrowse.org/releases/JBrowse-1.4.1-full.zip) - 5.5M
    Changes in this release:

-   Made displayColumns option for the faceted track selector
    case-insensitive, and interpret a column name of "Name" as meaning
    the track's key.
-   `bam-to-json.pl` now filters out alignments that are not at least
    two nucleotides in length. Thanks to Tristan Lubinski for
    assistance.
-   Introduced limits on the sizes of cookies that can be set,
    preventing '400 bad request' errors (issue #113).
