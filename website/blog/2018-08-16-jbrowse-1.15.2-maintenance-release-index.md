JBrowse 1.15.2 has been released! This contains a couple nice features including
estimating feature density directly from the index file of BAM, VCF, and other
tabix formats. We also updated the website with a new blogging and documentation
platform! Please try it out and give us feedback.

Enjoy browsing!

## Minor improvements

- Created "index stats estimation" which overrides the older "global stats
  estimation" that randomly samples genomic regions of BAM, VCF, etc to find
  feature density. This allows initial track load to be faster automatically.

- Removed the "full" or "dev" releases from the build. If you need a "dev"
  release, you can simply download the JBrowse "source code" link from the
  GitHub releases page, or use a git clone of the JBrowse repository. This will
  behave the same as the "dev" release.

- JBrowse now uses a new binary-file caching and fetching backend based on the
  [http-range-fetcher](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-range-fetcher) and
  [tenacious-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tenacious-fetch) npm modules.
  Users may see slightly higher performance when viewing indexed binary formats
  such as BAM, CRAM, 2bit, etc.

- Updated the main jbrowse.org website to use the docusaurus platform. The main
  docs for the website are now moved from the GMOD.org server to jbrowse.org.
  You can find the latest documentation in the header bar. We hope you will
  enjoy this upgrade! There is also a new quick start guide based on setting up
  JBrowse with indexed file formats.

- Fixes issue where navigating away from genome browser and returning would not
  remember the location. Thanks to Vaneet Lotay for reporting.
