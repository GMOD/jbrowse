JBrowse 1.8.1 has been released, with several small fixes and additional features, mostly related to displaying features on peptide sequences.

Files for download:

    Changes in this release:

-   Added support for `cigarAttribute` and `mdAttributes` configuration
    variables to Alignments and Alignments2 tracks, allowing users to
    change which feature attribute is used for showing mismatches
    (issue #200).
-   Fixed some bugs preventing `Alignments` and `Alignments2` tracks
    from working with non-BAM data backends.
-   Added `--trackLabel` and `--key` options to `prepare-refseqs.pl`,
    allowing users to specify the sequence track's label and title.
-   Added `--seqType` option to `prepare-refseqs.pl`, allowing users to
    specify the type of sequences being formatted, usually either
    'dna', 'rna', or 'protein'. Additionally, if --seqType is
    something over than DNA (case insensitive), "showReverseStrand" is
    set to false on the reference sequence track.
-   Added a `shareURL` configuration option that accepts a JS function
    to assemble the URL that users will get when clicking the "Share"
    button or the "Full view" link in embedded mode (issue #198).
-   Fixed annoying bug in which popup feature detail boxes are
    initially scrolled all the way to the bottom.
