    Changes in this release:

-   Fixed bug in which JBrowse could not properly display all data in
    BAM files with reference sequence name sections bigger than 64KB.
    Thanks to GitHub user lfgu for pointing this out (issue #245).
-   Made REST feature store backend less sensitive more tolerant of
    stringification of `start`, `end`, `strand`, and `score` in feature
    JSON. Thanks to Matt Bomhoff for pointing this out.
-   Fixed bug in which URLs for plugin resources were not assembled
    relative to the `browserRoot` config variable. Thanks to Matt
    Bomhoff for pointing this out.
-   Fixed bug in which missing fields in a VCF variant's genotype
    prevented display of a variant's details. Thanks to Jillian Rowe
    for pointing this out.
-   Fixed some minor issues related to the handling of empty BigWig
    files. Thanks to Nathan Boley for pointing this out (issue #252).
-   The `trackSelector.type` global config variable can now contain
    fully-qualified class names, so plugins can contain their own
    tracklist classes. Thanks to Matt Bomhoff for pointing this out.
-   Moved the "Select tracks" tab used to open the faceted track
    selector downward, so that it does not block access to the left
    side of the reference sequence overview.
