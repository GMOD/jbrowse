I'm pleased to announce the release of JBrowse 1.16.4. This has a couple of
specialized fixes.

One fix provides a better error message if you give improper inputs for tabix or
BAI files that actually require CSI indexes. This came up often for people in
the wheat genome.

Another helps display multiple transcript features for a gene top level feature
from HTMLFeatures

## Minor improvements

- Added `indexedFeatures` tracklist attribute for GFF3Tabix track types which
  controls the feature types from a GFF3Tabix file that are indexed. Thanks to
  <a href="https://github.com/loraine-gueguen">@loraine-gueguen</a> for the idea
  and implementation! (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1337">issue
  #1337</a>, <a href="https://github.com/loraine-guegen">@loraine-guegen</a>)

- Added `inferHTMLSubfeatures` which automatically creates multiple mRNA
  transcripts from a single gene parent feature. Thanks to
  <a href="https://github.com/abretaud">@abretaud</a> for the idea and
  implementation! Note that this is enabled by default now

- Updated jbrowse.org website to run entirely off amazon S3

## Bug fixes

- Added better error reporting to GFF3Tabix tracks for if a parsing error
  occured. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/nathanhaigh">@nathanhaigh</a>
  for reporting (<a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)

- Added fix for VCF that don't contain alternative alleles
  (<a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)

- Added better error handling if there is a case where a tabix file is loaded
  that is on a genome longer than 2^29. CSI indexes are needed for this. Old
  versions of tabix which hadn't invented CSI would generate invalid tabix
  indexes in this case. Thanks to Hans Vasquez-Gross for reporting
  (<a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)

- Fixed link in documentation. Thanks

- Fixed issue with ucsc-to-json.pl creating subfeatures with the wrong strand.
