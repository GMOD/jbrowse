Courtesy of Dave Clements: JBrowse appears (and gets a laugh, for some reason)
at 8:41 in
[this TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_resnick_welcome_to_the_genomic_revolution.html)
("Welcome to the genomic revolution" by Richard Resnick).

In other news, we are happy to report that JBrowse has had its R01 funding
support from NHGRI renewed for three years. This enables a whole lot of exciting
stuff. We will post further developments here in the coming weeks.
