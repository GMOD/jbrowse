## Minor improvements

- Gene, ProcessedTranscript, and Segments glyphs can now render third-level
  subfeatures (such as `stop_codon_read_through` features) as simple boxes that
  draw on top of the main segment glyph. Thanks to
  [@mpoelchau](https://github.com/mpoelchau) for pointing out the need for this!
  ([issue #584](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/584),
  [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

- CanvasFeatures tracks, when guessing which glyph to show for a feature in a
  track that does not specify glyphs in its configuration, will now use a
  Segments glyph instead of a Box glyph if the feature in question has
  subfeatures, and is not otherwise recognized as a gene or processed
  transcript. [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels)

- Added a check in the `setup.sh` script for NodeJS >= 6 and NPM >= 3.
  ([issue #1026](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1026),
  [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

- Plugins that don't need CSS can now set `jbrowsePlugin.css` to `false` in
  their package.json files to prevent JBrowse trying to load their css/main.css
  file, if they don't use any CSS. ([@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

- Add ability for the CanvasFeatures feature labels to stay visible on the
  screen. ([issue #390](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/390),
  [issue #971](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/971),
  [@cmdcolin](https://github.com/cmdcolin),
  [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

- Improve VCF tracks support for GVCF generated by GATK, and fix a number of
  related VCF details display bugs.
  ([issue #991](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/991),
  [@cmdcolin](https://github.com/cmdcolin))

- `generate-names.pl` now supports indexing GFF3 files, enabling better use of
  GFF3Tabix tracks. Thanks to [@billzt](https://github.com/billzt) for the
  initial implementation!
  ([issue #780](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/780),
  [issue #900](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/900),
  [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

- CanvasFeatures `ProcessedTranscript` and `Gene` glyphs now support a
  "style&rarr;utrHeightPercent" configuration variable that sets the percentage
  of the overall feature's height that UTRs have. This was previously hardcoded
  to 65, now it is customizable, defaulting to its old value of 65.
  [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels)

## Bug fixes

- Updated `NeatCanvasFeatures` and `NeatHTMLFeatures` plugins to support a
  `gradient` configuration variable, fix rendering of outrons, restore their
  default gradient-drawing behavior, disable gradients by default on Alignments
  and Alignments2 track types, and clean up their documentation.

  [issue #1011](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1011),
  [@enuggetry](https://github.com/enuggetry))

- Fixed a bug with plugin loading that was preventing some plugins from working
  correctly. ([issue #1025](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1025),
  [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

- `flatfile-to-json.pl` will now refuse to format a track if the trackLabel
  contains a '/' character. Thanks to [@dytk2134](https://github.com/dytk2134)
  for pointing this out, and [@cmdcolin](https://github.com/cmdcolin) for the
  fix! ([issue #1023](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1023),
  [@cmdcolin](https://github.com/cmdcolin))

- Fixed a bug in which the viewing location would not be preserved across page
  reloads if `generate-names.pl` had not been run, or a names store had not
  otherwise been defined. Thanks to [@cmdcolin](https://github.com/cmdcolin) for
  the bug report. ([issue #1016](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1016),
  [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))
