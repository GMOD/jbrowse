We recently used JBrowse in the 150 Tomato Genome ReSequencing project, and it
worked great!

The aim of the 150 Tomato Genome ReSequencing project
([http://www.tomatogenome.net](http://www.tomatogenome.net)) is to reveal and
explore the genetic variation available in tomato. Tomato has been selected as
target crop because it is economically one of the most important crop species
for the Dutch breeding industry, and is one the most important vegetables
globally. However, since the tomato shows only limited genetic diversity in
commercial breeding lines, valuable alleles will be available in wild tomato
relatives. Since breeding and selection was targeted at only a narrow range of
desirable agricultural traits, also old breeding material could be source of
interesting alleles that have been lost during domestication.

In order to identify the sequence diversity within tomato, 83 genotypes
including 10 old varieties, 43 land races and 30 wild accessions were seqeunced.
These wild tomato species represent the full range of expected genetic variation
around \_S. lycopersicum \_that can still be used as potential breeding
material.

Sequences have been mapped against the reference genome of _S. lycopersicum_ cv.
Heinz (SL2.40) and SNP and INDEL variation has been determined.

JBrowse is a fast, embeddable genome browser built completely with JavaScript
and HTML5, with optional run-once data formatting tools written in Perl.

The SNP and INDEL variants have been made available using JBowse
([http://www.tomatogenome.net/VariantBrowser/](http://www.tomatogenome.net/VariantBrowser/))
and an tutorial
([http://gmod.org/wiki/JBrowse#Tutorials](http://gmod.org/wiki/JBrowse#Tutorials))
on how to explore this data resource by the community has been written.

In addition to variants from the 150+ Tomato Genome ReSequencing project, we
will add publicly available variant datasets as well.
