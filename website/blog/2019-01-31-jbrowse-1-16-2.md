## Minor improvements

- Allow configuring the cache busting behavior for adding random ?v= value to
  config file requests. This can be configured in index.html. Thanks to user
  <a href="https://github.com/sandilyaamit">@sandilyaamit</a> for reporting,
  this is actually important to disable when using Amazon presigned URLs
  (<a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)

- Adds `fixBounds` config for XYPlot tracks which can be set to false to disable
  the behavior of rounding up or down on the min_score/max_score variables for
  the ruler. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/scottcain">@scottcain</a> for
  the suggestion (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1306">issue
