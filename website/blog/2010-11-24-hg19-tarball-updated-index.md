Chris Tandiono reported a bug in the [hg19 tarball](http://jbrowse.org/?p=111),
and supplied a script to fix the problem. The tarball has now been updated with
the fix; you can download the new version here:

[http://jbrowse.org/releases/hg19mini-2.tar.gz](http://jbrowse.org/releases/hg19mini-2.tar.gz)

The bug prevented name/id searching from working; with the fixed tarball,
searches work again.

**Update:**
[a newer hg19 tarball has been released](http://jbrowse.org/hg19-tarball-updated-to-jbrowse-1-2-1/ 'hg19 tarball updated to JBrowse 1.2.1'),
you should use that one.
