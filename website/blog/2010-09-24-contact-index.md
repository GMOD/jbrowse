## Contact

If you have questions or issues with JBrowse, please write to the mailing list. Even better (if you have a feature request) try searching the GitHub issue system to see if your issue is already known, then either comment on an existing issue, or add a new one.

Since JBrowse is a public project, if you email us with questions about how to use JBrowse, we will most likely CC the mailing list on the conversation unless you specifically ask us not to.
