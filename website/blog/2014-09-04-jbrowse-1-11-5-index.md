A new JBrowse release has arrived! JBrowse 1.11.5 incorporates many valuable contributions and feedback from the community which has been overwhelmingly positive. Some notable bugs have been fixed, including a long-standing VCF file parsing bug, a scrolling bug that affected popup boxes for variants on JBrowse 1.11.4, and a patch for setup.sh build errors. There are also some new configuration options for the tracklist and dialog boxes, and the ability to use tablet and touch-screen devices has been fixed!
