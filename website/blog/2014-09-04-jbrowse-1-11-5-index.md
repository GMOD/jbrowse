A new JBrowse release has arrived! JBrowse 1.11.5 incorporates many valuable
contributions and feedback from the community which has been overwhelmingly
positive. Some notable bugs have been fixed, including a long-standing VCF file
parsing bug, a scrolling bug that affected popup boxes for variants on JBrowse
1.11.4, and a patch for setup.sh build errors. There are also some new
configuration options for the tracklist and dialog boxes, and the ability to use
tablet and touch-screen devices has been fixed!
