## Minor improvements

 * Added a 'Reset to defaults' menu item, which addresses a long standing
   issue. Thanks to a user with a very long github name for their
   contribution (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1496">issue #1496</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/764">issue #764</a>).

 * Disable coordinate indicator on tab switch, thanks <a href="https://github.com/lukaw3d">@lukaw3d</a> (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1497">issue #1497</a>)

 * Small optimization bumping <a href="https://github.com/gmod">@gmod</a>/bam from version 1.0.35->1.0.36 (<a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)

 * Add ability to include/hide variant filters instead of just hide
   (<a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1478">issue #1478</a>)

 * Add ability to color by TS tag. The useXS config now applies to `XS` and
   `TS`, and the useTS tag only applies to the lower-case `ts` tag used by
   minimap2 (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1493">issue #1493</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)

## Bug fixes

 * Fixed a race condition in the http-range-fetcher module that caused
   "Error: "failed to retrieve file size"" messages when many tracks
   were opened at once. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/russellmyers">@russellmyers</a> for the bug report!
   (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1473">issue #1473</a>)

 * Fixed error with exporting highlighted regions with Save track data,
   thanks to <a href="https://github.com/lipan6461188">@lipan6461188</a> for reporting (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1488">issue #1488</a>)

 * Fixed ability to have custom mouseovers on features that have no
   default mouseover e.g. features with no name or ID. Thanks to
   <a href="https://github.com/scottcain">@scottcain</a> for reporting (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1487">issue #1487</a>)

 * Fixed the response for requests to HTTP 403 errors. Thanks to
   <a href="https://github.com/ilaydabozan">@ilaydabozan</a> for reporting (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1490">issue #1490</a>)

 * When there is only a single coordinate column in a tabix file, there
   is now improved performance since the overlap checking code was
   incorrect before in <a href="https://github.com/gmod">@gmod</a>/tabix (<a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)

 * Fix usage of bigwig "scoreType":"maxScore" config for bigwig tracks
   (<a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1380">issue #1380</a>)

 * Fix a crash related to NCList histogram when a featureScale is applied
   (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1327">issue #1327</a>)

 * Make it so that VCF tracks don't require CORS headers for Content-Range
   (<a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)
