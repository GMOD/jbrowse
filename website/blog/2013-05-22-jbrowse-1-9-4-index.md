Changes in this release:

*   Fixed a bug with configuration handling that preventing disabling
right-click feature menus, and probably had other undesirable
effects. Thanks to Daniel Troesser for pointing this out
(issue #260).
*   Fixed a bug in which facet renaming specified in the
`trackSelector.renameFacets` configuration variable was not
properly applied to facet titles in the accordion widget on the
left side of the faceted track selector (issue #251). Thanks to
Jason Gao for pointing this out.
*   Fixed a bug with GFF3 and Sequin Table export of GFF3
alternate_allele attributes. Thanks to Jillian Rowe for pointing
this out (issue #256).
*   Fixed some hard-coded image paths that were not respecting the
setting of the `browserRoot` configuration variable. Thanks to
Harry Yoo for pointing this out (issue #258).
*   Fixed a bug in which running `biodb-to-json.pl` with no arguments
caused it to crash instead of producing help output. Thanks to
GitHub user sreyesch for pointing this out (issue #257).
*   Fixed a bug in which some browsers report that
src/dijit/_editor/nls/commands.js is missing. Thanks to Steffi
Geisen for pointing this out.
