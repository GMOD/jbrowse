    Changes in this release:

    files with large numbers of reference sequences from displaying.
    Thanks to Gregg Helt for providing sample data to help isolate
    this.

-   Fixed a bug in the BigWig data backend that prevented BigWig files
    rendering in Safari. Thanks to Gregor Rot for his help in isolating this.

-   Worked around a bug in Safari 6 (and probably earlier) in which
    HTTP byte-range requests are erroneously cached. Thanks to Gregor
    Rot for pointing out the Safari problems.

-   Fixed some minor styling bugs in the facet menus of the faceted
    track selector.

-   Fixed blurry edges of location trapezoid in Firefox (Eric Derohanian).
