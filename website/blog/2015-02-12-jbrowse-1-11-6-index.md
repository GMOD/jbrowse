I'm pleased to announce JBrowse 1.11.6 is now available! Everybody's feedback,
bug reports, pull requests, and feature requests have been invaluable for making
this happen. This release includes new UI options for easily setting "Log scale"
on wiggle tracks and dynamically changing strandedness on RNA-seq according to
multi-segment template flags and splice site (XS) flags. It also includes bug
fixes for calculating SNP positions on certain flag combinations in BAM files
and for reporting the correct genotypes on certain VCF tracks. Enjoy!

## Minor improvements

- Added the ability to customize the contents of HTMLFeatures and CanvasFeatures
  mouseover tooltips more extensively. Thanks to David Muller for the original
  bug report and Colin Diesh for the fix
  ([issue #480](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/480)).
- Added new options for BigWig files to use min/max summary values when zoomed
  out using `scoreType`. Thanks to Scott Cain for reporting the issue and to
  Colin Diesh for the fix
  ([issue #518](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/518)).
- Added a checkbox for wiggle type tracks to have log scale. Thanks to Han Lin
  for the pull request
  ([issue #502](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/502)).
- Added the ability to display paired-end reads in the same direction on
  Alignments2 tracks with the "Use reverse template" option. Thanks to Tomaz
  Berisa and Colin Diesh for their contributions
  ([issue #485](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/485)).
- Added the ability to parse boolean literals from the .conf files.
- Added the ability to specify a codon table (or partial codon table) for the
  Sequence track.
- Added the ability to show or hide the main menu bar using the configuration
  file.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed "boolean is not a function" error when using CanvasFeatures tracks with
  the Segments glyph in some situations.
- Fixed a dialog box display issue for VCF variants with "no call" specified
  ([issue #513](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/513)).
- Fixed loading files from certain filepaths with special characters. Thanks to
  Ben Bimber for reporting and helping diagnose the bug
  ([issue #508](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/508)).
- Fixed popup-dialog callbacks not being called on BAM Alignments tracks in
  1.11.5.
- Fixed systemwide installations of JBrowse perl modules when using
  Module::Build.
- Fixed a bug when displaying SNPs on hard clipped reads. Thanks to Thon de Boer
  for the bug report and to Colin Diesh for the fix
  ([issue #516](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/516)).
- Fixed a bug when displaying SNPs on spliced alignments. Thanks to GitHub user
  09140930 for the bug report and to Colin Diesh for the fix
  ([issue #523](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/523)).
- Fixed a bug that affected some VCF and GFF popup dialogs in some browsers,
  particularly Chrome 38
  ([issue #522](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/522)).
- Fixed a bug with the incremental indexing with generate-names that associated
  the wrong track with the name store. Thanks to Richard Hayes for reporting
  this issue and to Colin Diesh for the fix
  ([issue #526](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/526)).
- Fixed the `--workdir` parameter in generate-names.pl

- Fixed the display of alternative alleles in the genotype for VCF pop-ups
  ([issue #533](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/533)).
- Fixed an issue where some paired-end read data wouldn't display properly if
  they had the same start position
  ([issue #521](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/521)).
- Output .htaccess file for generate-names.pl when using the compress option.
  Thanks to Sebastien Carrere for reporting the bug
  ([issue #541](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/541)).
- Fixed a small bug with being able to scroll past end of chromosome when using
  the `--sizes` option to prepare-refseqs.pl
  ([issue #535](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/535)).
- Fixed a small internal code inconsistency with the positioning of the vertical
  position line. Thanks to Anurag Priyam for the fix
  ([issue #545](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/545)).
- Fixed a small bug with some stylesheets not being able to be used for the
  CanvasFeatures coloring, for example, LESS stylesheets. Thanks to Anurag
  Priyam for reporting the issue
  ([issue #527](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/527)).
- Fixed a small bug with mouseovers on Wiggle type tracks. Thanks to Han Lin for
  finding and fixing this bug
  ([issue #503](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/503)).
- Removed XS tag from the strand calculation for alignments and made it an
  optional rendering option for BAM files with the "Use XS" option. Thanks to
  Kieran Raine and the pull request
