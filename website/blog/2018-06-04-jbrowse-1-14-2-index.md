## Minor improvements

*   Added a `datasetSelectorWidth` configuration key that sets the width of the dataset
selector. The width defaults to `15em`. Example setting in tracks.conf:
`
[GENERAL]
classicMenu = true
datasetSelectorWidth = 20em
`
Thanks to [@srobb1](https://github.com/srobb1) for pointing out the need for this. ([issue #1059](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1059), [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

*   When exporting GFF3 from the 'Save track data' menu, the `##sequence-region` pragma now
specifies the exact sequence region that was exported from the UI. Thanks to [@mwdavis2](https://github.com/mwdavis2)
for pointing this out! ([issue #905](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/905), [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

*   Improved the welcome screen for the desktop version of JBrowse
([issue #1045](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1045), [issue #1050](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1050), [@cmdcolin](https://github.com/cmdcolin))

## Bug fixes

*   Fixed the `--config` option for `add-bw-track.pl`.  Although documented in the script's POD,
it was not actually being processed. Thanks to [@loraine-gueguen](https://github.com/loraine-gueguen) for noticing it, and for
contributing the fix! ([issue #1063](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1063), [issue #1064](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1064), [@loraine-gueguen](https://github.com/loraine-gueguen))

*   Fixed a bug in which setup.sh failed if run twice in a row under some circumstances.
([issue #1053](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1053), [@cmdcolin](https://github.com/cmdcolin))

*   Fixed a bug in which setup.sh did not accept nodejs version 10 as sufficiently recent.
([issue #1048](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1048), [@cmdcolin](https://github.com/cmdcolin))

*   Fixed a bug in which the "Loading..." message erroneously appeared at the top of the
dataset-selection page. Many thanks to [@srobb1](https://github.com/srobb1) for noticing this and reporting it!
([issue #1057](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1057), [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

*   JSON syntax errors in the new configuration loading code now have better error messages.
