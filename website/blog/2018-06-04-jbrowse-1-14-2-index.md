## Minor improvements

- Added a `datasetSelectorWidth` configuration key that sets the width of the
  dataset selector. The width defaults to `15em`. Example setting in
  tracks.conf: `[GENERAL] classicMenu = true datasetSelectorWidth = 20em` Thanks
  to [@srobb1](https://github.com/srobb1) for pointing out the need for this.

  [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

- When exporting GFF3 from the 'Save track data' menu, the `##sequence-region`
  pragma now specifies the exact sequence region that was exported from the UI.
  Thanks to [@mwdavis2](https://github.com/mwdavis2) for pointing this out!

## Bug fixes

- Fixed the `--config` option for `add-bw-track.pl`. Although documented in the
  script's POD, it was not actually being processed. Thanks to
  [@loraine-gueguen](https://github.com/loraine-gueguen) for noticing it, and
  for contributing the fix!
  ([issue #1063](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1063),
  [issue #1064](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1064),
  [@loraine-gueguen](https://github.com/loraine-gueguen))

- Fixed a bug in which setup.sh failed if run twice in a row under some
  circumstances. ([issue #1053](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1053),
  [@cmdcolin](https://github.com/cmdcolin))

- Fixed a bug in which setup.sh did not accept nodejs version 10 as sufficiently
  recent. ([issue #1048](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1048),
  [@cmdcolin](https://github.com/cmdcolin))

- Fixed a bug in which the "Loading..." message erroneously appeared at the top
  of the dataset-selection page. Many thanks to
  [@srobb1](https://github.com/srobb1) for noticing this and reporting it!
  ([issue #1057](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1057),
  [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

- JSON syntax errors in the new configuration loading code now have better error
  messages. Thanks to [@billzt](https://github.com/billzt) for pointing out the
  need for this! ([issue #1061](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1061),
