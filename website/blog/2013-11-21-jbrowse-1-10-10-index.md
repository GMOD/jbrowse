JBrowse 1.10.10 has been released, with new compression support in `generate-names.pl`, configurable inter-track spacing, and quite a few bug fixes.

<div style="padding: 2em 1em; margin: 1em; border: 1px solid #eee; background: #fcfcfc">(Download disabled.  Please download the[ 1.10.12 release](http://jbrowse.org/jbrowse-1-10-12/ "JBrowse 1.10.12 maintenance release") or later instead.)
</div>

## Minor improvements

*   Spacing between tracks is now configurable by setting
`view.trackPadding` in the configuration.  Thanks to Chenchen Zhu
for suggesting this ([issue #377](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/377)).

*   If reference sequences are defined, but no tracks are yet added,
JBrowse will start normally instead of going to the
"Congratulations, JBrowse is on the web" page.

*   `generate-names.pl` now supports a `--compress` option that
compresses the name index files to save server disk space.  Thanks
to Richard Hayes for pointing out the need for this ([issue #378](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/378)).

## Bug fixes

*   `generate-names.pl` now uses IO::Uncompress::Gunzip instead of
PerlIO::gzip to read compressed VCF files.  This fixes a bug in
which only the first few hundred names in a VCF were indexed.
Thanks to Cris Lawrence for pointing this out ([issue #380](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/380)).

*   Fixed a bug in which `generate-names.pl` would crash if run with
`--incremental` and no existing names index.  Thanks to Richard
Hayes for pointing this out ([issue #379](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/379)).

*   Fixed a bug in which `generate-names.pl` would sometimes choose the
wrong number of hash bits when performing incremental updates,
leading to the old data being lost.  Thanks to Richard Hayes for
lots of help troubleshooting this.

*   Fixed bug where other tracks are visible underneath pinned tracks
when the display is scrolled down.  Thanks to Ed Lee for pointing
this out.

*   Fixed a bug in which tooltip does not hide after the mouse leaves a
Wiggle track in Safari 5 and 6. Thanks to Charles Girardot for
pointing this out.

*   Fixed a bug in which the `main.css` file for plugins was not being
correctly loaded in some installations.  Thanks to Matt Bomhoff for
pointing this out.
