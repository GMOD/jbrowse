Thanks to some great work by Juan Aguilar, JBrowse now runs on the iPad. Working
with Lincoln Stein, Juan hooked up JBrowse to the iOS JavaScript touch/gesture
callbacks.

The result is very cool indeed. Click
[here](http://jbrowse.org/ucsc/hg19/touch.html) to see it in action (um, using
an iPad, naturally; if you have an iPhone, it will still work, but the screen is
a bit small to do anything meaningful).

Alternatively, you can watch it here:

<object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="FMVtxTt6KCg?fs=1&hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/FMVtxTt6KCg?fs=1&hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object>

This code should (fingers crossed) make it into the next release. It's still
"alpha" at the moment, but several people have asked for JBrowse on the iPad,
and we do hate to disappoint.
