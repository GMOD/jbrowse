## Minor improvements

*   JBrowse now supports .idx indexes for VCFs that are generated by `igvtools` or GATK. Currently
only VCF files can be used with this index type, but this could be expanded to other file types
if users are interested. Thanks to [@thon-deboer](https://github.com/thon-deboer) for suggesting this! ([issue #1019](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1019), [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

*   The dropdown dataset selector in "classic menu" mode is now a type-ahead combo box, enabling
fast searching through large numbers of datasets. Thanks to [@keiranmraine](https://github.com/keiranmraine) for the suggestion!
([issue #752](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/752), [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

*   There is now a new event named `/jbrowse/v1/n/tracks/redrawFinished` that fires after the
view is refreshed, when all of the visible tracks are finished drawing (or have errored).
Thanks to [@scottcain](https://github.com/scottcain) for suggesting this. ([issue #1027](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1027), [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

*   Improve the calculation of feature density for GFF3Tabix and add new one for GFF3 in-memory.
Thanks to [@hkmoon](https://github.com/hkmoon) for the suggestion! ([issue #1039](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1039), [issue #913](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/913), [@cmdcolin](https://github.com/cmdcolin))

*   Re-enabled JBrowse Desktop builds based on automatically building on Travis-CI
([issue #1028](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1028), [@cmdcolin](https://github.com/cmdcolin))

## Bug fixes

*   Fixed several bugs related to the file-opening dialog's handling of indexed file types
(bam+bai, gz+tbi, etc). Thanks to [@sletort](https://github.com/sletort) for submitting the bug report! ([issue #1033](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1033), [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

*   The Perl formatting tools now properly read `include`-ed configuration files. Thanks to [@carrere](https://github.com/carrere)
for pointing out this bug. ([issue #551](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/551), [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

*   Fixed a bug in which the faceted track selector was nonfunctional in Internet Explorer 11.
