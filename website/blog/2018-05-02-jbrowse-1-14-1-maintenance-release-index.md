## Minor improvements

- JBrowse now supports .idx indexes for VCFs that are generated by `igvtools` or
  GATK. Currently only VCF files can be used with this index type, but this
  could be expanded to other file types if users are interested. Thanks to
  [@thon-deboer](https://github.com/thon-deboer) for suggesting this!
  ([issue #1019](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1019),
  [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

- The dropdown dataset selector in "classic menu" mode is now a type-ahead combo
  box, enabling fast searching through large numbers of datasets. Thanks to
  [@keiranmraine](https://github.com/keiranmraine) for the suggestion!
  ([issue #752](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/752),
  [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

- There is now a new event named `/jbrowse/v1/n/tracks/redrawFinished` that
  fires after the view is refreshed, when all of the visible tracks are finished
  drawing (or have errored). Thanks to
  [@scottcain](https://github.com/scottcain) for suggesting this.
  ([issue #1027](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1027),
  [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

- Improve the calculation of feature density for GFF3Tabix and add new one for
  GFF3 in-memory. Thanks to [@hkmoon](https://github.com/hkmoon) for the
  suggestion! ([issue #1039](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1039),
  [issue #913](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/913),
  [@cmdcolin](https://github.com/cmdcolin))

- Re-enabled JBrowse Desktop builds based on automatically building on Travis-CI
