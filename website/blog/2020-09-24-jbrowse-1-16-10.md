Hello all,

This release contains changes that help people rendering SNPs from reads with multiple CIGAR skips, e.g. Iso-Seq. It also includes a modest speedup for long reads and automatic generation of MD tags for BAM, and more. Please see the changelog below!

-   [JBrowse-1.16.10.zip](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse/releases/download/1.16.10-release/JBrowse-1.16.10.zip) - minified release
-   [JBrowse-1.16.10-dev.zip](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse/archive/1.16.10-release.zip) - use this if you modify jbrowse source code or use plugins
-   [JBrowse-1.16.10-desktop-win32-x64.zip](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse/releases/download/1.16.10-release/JBrowse-1.16.10-desktop-win32-x64.zip)
-   [JBrowse-1.16.10-desktop-linux-x64.zip](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse/releases/download/1.16.10-release/JBrowse-1.16.10-desktop-linux-x64.zip)
-   [JBrowse-1.16.10-desktop-darwin-x64.zip](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse/releases/download/1.16.10-release/JBrowse-1.16.10-desktop-darwin-x64.zip)

## Minor improvements

-   Added an optimization for BAM that helps for long reads especially

-   Added generation of the MD tag if none is specified in BAM (issue
    #1022, <a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)

-   Added `customRefRename` and `replaceRefRename` global configs for
    extending and replacing ref renaming functionality respectively.
    Ref renaming helps things like chrM and chrMT to be loaded onto the
    same chromosome in jbrowse (<a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1506">issue #1506</a>)

-   Added support for a -f option for setup.sh. This option causes
    setup to skip installing perl prerequisites and setting up
    sample data. It is primarily intended to support faster builds
    in a Docker context. (<a href="https://github.com/scottcain">@scottcain</a>)

## Bug fixes

-   Fix the display of mismatches from hard clipped BAM sequences (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1513">issue #1513</a>)

-   Fix ability to use tracks from Open track dialog in combination tracks.
    Thanks to Sonny Arora for the repo (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1536">issue #1536</a>)

-   Fix mismatch/SNP calculation for reads with multiple skips, e.g. Iso-Seq
