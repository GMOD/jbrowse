Hello all,

This release contains changes that help people rendering SNPs from reads with
multiple CIGAR skips, e.g. Iso-Seq. It also includes a modest speedup for long
reads and automatic generation of MD tags for BAM, and more. Please see the
changelog below!

## Minor improvements

- Added an optimization for BAM that helps for long reads especially

- Added generation of the MD tag if none is specified in BAM (issue #1022,
  <a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)

- Added `customRefRename` and `replaceRefRename` global configs for extending
  and replacing ref renaming functionality respectively. Ref renaming helps
  things like chrM and chrMT to be loaded onto the same chromosome in jbrowse

- Added support for a -f option for setup.sh. This option causes setup to skip
  installing perl prerequisites and setting up sample data. It is primarily
  intended to support faster builds in a Docker context.

## Bug fixes

- Fix the display of mismatches from hard clipped BAM sequences

- Fix ability to use tracks from Open track dialog in combination tracks. Thanks
  to Sonny Arora for the repo
  (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1536">issue #1536</a>)

- Fix mismatch/SNP calculation for reads with multiple skips, e.g. Iso-Seq
