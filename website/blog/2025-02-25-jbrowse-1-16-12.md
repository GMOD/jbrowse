Hi all, It's been awhile since the last jbrowse 1 release but this fixes an XSS
vulnerability reported to us. It is fairly low severity for most cases but we
encourage you to consider upgrading, and learn about reflected XSS. See the PR
at https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse/pull/1657 for more details

There may be some follow up releases to this one, but this release only fixes
this specific issue that was reported
