## Minor improvements

-   Rewrote many parts of generate-names.pl, making heavy use of
    temporary BerkeleyDB stores (using Perl's DB_File module). This
    improves generate-names.pl performance by more than 10x.
-   Added a File->Add sequence search track menu item that can make
    tracks that show which regions of the reference sequence contain a
    given (small) sequence, or match a given regular expression.
    Thanks to Daniel Kasenberg for the initial implementation of this
    (issue #315).
-   Added a CanvasVariants track type, similar to HTMLVariants, which
    utilizes the faster CanvasFeatures rendering backend for displaying
    variant data.
-   Added checkboxes to HTMLVariants and CanvasVariants track menus
    that allow filtering displayed features based on the FILTER
    attribute in a VCF file. In addition to filtering based on the
    presence or absence of PASS, users can filter based on the custom
    filters defined in the VCF header. Thanks to Keiran Raine and
    Andrew Uzilov for suggesting this (issue #344).
-   Added "Hide forward strand" and "Hide reverse strand" checkboxes to
    Alignments and Alignments2 track menus that allow alignments on the
    forward and/or reverse strands to be hidden.

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed a bug that prevented indexing of feature aliases in the names
    index when running generate-names.pl.
-   Fixed a bug that prevented proper display of the "ibeam" feature
    class in HTMLFeatures tracks. Thanks to Ed Lee for pointing this
    out.
