Changes in this release:

*   Fixed a bug in which typing a key that is bound to a global
keyboard shortcut (currently only 't' or '?') in the location box
would erroneously execute the action for that global shortcut.
Thanks to Gregor Rot for pointing this out.

*   Fixed a bug in which toggling 'Show labels' in the track menu did
not re-layout the track on the first toggling.

*   Make columns in the faceted track selector initially each be an
equal percentage of the total width of the grid.  Thanks to Steffi
Geisen for pointing this out.
