JBrowse 1.15.3 has been released! This contains an bugfix introduced in 1.15.0
where typing a reference sequence name in the search bar did not navigate to it
properly. It also contains a cool feature where "ultra minimal configs" can be
specified by simply specifying a track label and urlTemplate

For example, a directory containing indexed files like VCF, BAM, GFF3 tabix, and
indexed FASTA can have a config simply like this in tracks.conf

```
[GENERAL]
refSeqs=volvox.fa.fai
[tracks.refseq]
urlTemplate=volvox.fa
[tracks.bam]
urlTemplate=volvox-sorted.bam
[tracks.cram]
urlTemplate=volvox-sorted.cram
[tracks.vcf]
urlTemplate=volvox.filtered.vcf.gz
[tracks.gff]
urlTemplate=volvox.sort.gff3.gz
[tracks.bed]
urlTemplate=volvox.sort.bed.gz
```

## Minor improvements

- Add ability to automatically deduce the storeClass and trackType of files
  based on the file extension of urlTemplate. This allows very minimal configs
  where only track label and urlTemplate can be specified.
