The folks over at [genomesunzipped.org](https://www.genomesunzipped.org/2010/10/our-genomes-unzipped.php) are trying an interesting experiment in personal genomics. A group of experts in fields related to personal genomics are analysing their own genomes (via 23andMe) and making all the results available online. Naturally they chose JBrowse as their genome browser :-)

It will be very interesting to see how this experiment in transparency plays out, and what kinds of discussion it provokes. More [here](https://www.genomesunzipped.org/2010/10/our-genomes-unzipped.php).
