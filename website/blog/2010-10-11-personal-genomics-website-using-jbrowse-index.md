The folks over at
[genomesunzipped.org](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2010/10/our-genomes-unzipped.php)
are trying an interesting experiment in personal genomics. A group of experts in
fields related to personal genomics are analysing their own genomes (via
23andMe) and making all the results available online. Naturally they chose
JBrowse as their genome browser :-)

It will be very interesting to see how this experiment in transparency plays
out, and what kinds of discussion it provokes. More
