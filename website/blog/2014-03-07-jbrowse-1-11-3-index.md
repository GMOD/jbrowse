JBrowse 1.11.3 has been released, with quite a few improvements and bugfixes,
including a new coloring scheme for BAM alignment tracks (Alignments2 tracks), a
fix for some annoying bugs with the feature arrowheads, and some nice new
configuration variables for customizing the display of certain fields in the
default feature detail popup dialog boxes (see the
[JBrowse Configuration Guide](http://gmod.org/wiki/JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Customizing_parts_of_the_.27View_details.27_Pop-ups_with_callbacks)
for details).

In addition, this will be my last JBrowse release in my position as JBrowse lead
developer. Thank you all for the past two years of development; we've made some
exciting strides, and it's been great!

## Minor improvements

- Added a "Zoom to this" item in the default right-click menus for canvas-based
  feature tracks. Thanks to Paul Hale for the initial implementation of this.
- Allow the user to set the document.domain property via jbrowse.conf which can
  be helpful especially if jbrowse is embedded in a iframe. Thanks to Kieran
  Raine for the idea and Colin Diesh for the bugfix
  ([issue #440](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/440))
- Improved the graphic design of the "Add sequence search" dialog box to make it
  clearer how to switch between providing an amino acid and a nucleotide
  sequence. Thanks to Kevin Mohamed for the initial implementation of this
  ([issue #436](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/436)).
- Expanded the default color set of `Alignments2` tracks to show different
  shades of color indications of reads with missing mate pairs, improperly
  aligned reads, and reads with mate pairs on different reference sequences.
  Thanks to Keiran Raine for implementing this
  ([issue #443](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/443)).
- Added support to customize specific parts of the 'View details' popups using
  callback functions. Thanks to Kieran Raine for the idea and Colin Diesh for
  the implementation ([issue #421](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/421)).
- The File->Open tool will now can add files named `*.coverage.*` or
  `*.density.*` as histograms to newly-opened tracks if the file basenames
  match. For example, if both `mysample.bam` and `mysample.coverage.bw` are
  present, `mysample.coverage.bw` will be added as a histogram source for
  `mysample.bam`. Thanks to Keiran Raine and Alexander Stoddard for suggesting
  this ([issue #423](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/423)).

## Bug fixes

- Fixed a problem where the feature arrowhead would get stuck in the middle of
  the screen at high zoom levels. Thanks to Colin Diesh for the fix
  ([issue #449](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/449)).
- Disabled the FASTA download button in the "View details" page on Safari
  ([issue #412](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/412)). This feature can't
  be supported in Safari at this time, but it is still supported in most other
  browsers. Rob Buels and Colin Diesh contributed fixes to this issue.
- Fixed a bug in the client-side GFF3 parser pointed out by Andrew Warren.
  Thanks Andrew! ([issue #452](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/452)).
- Fixed the problem of translation frames being switched around at different
  zoom levels. Thanks to Kieron Taylor for the bug report and Colin Diesh for
  the bugfix ([issue #435](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/435))
- Fixed a bug where gene features in GFF tracks would not have arrowhead
  markers. Thanks to Colin Diesh for finding and fixing this issue
  ([issue #454](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/454))
