## Minor Improvements

- Add a internal code attribute for XHR requests that use byte-range headers so
  that if a server does not support it, an error is returned immediately. Thanks
  to [@theChinster](https://github.com/theChinster) for the motivating example
  ([issue #1131](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1131),
  [issue #1132](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1132),
  [issue #1134](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1134),
  [@cmdcolin](https://github.com/cmdcolin)).

- Speed up TwoBit file processing with a robust implementation of the file spec.
  The improvements are contained in a new npm module
  [@gmod/twobit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gmod/twobit). Thanks to
  [@cmdcolin](https://github.com/cmdcolin) for some testing and motivating
  examples. ([issue #1116](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1116),
  [issue #1146](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1146),
  [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

- Added feature.get('seq') to CRAM features which enables detailed comparison of
  the read versus the reference with the renderAlignment configuration.
  ([issue #1126](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1126),
  [issue #1149](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1149),
  [@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

- Added support for 1000genomes CRAM 2.0 codecs via updates to the
  [@gmod](https://github.com/gmod)/cram npm module.
  ([@rbuels](https://github.com/rbuels))

- Add some better formatting for rich metadata in the "About this track" dialog
  boxes for tracks. Thanks to Wojtek Bażant for the idea and implementation!
  ([issue #1148](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1148),

## Bug fixes

- Fix bug where prepare-refseqs with indexed FASTA would allows scrolling past
  the end of the chromosome ([@cmdcolin](https://github.com/cmdcolin)).

- Fix long standing bug related to not being able to configure dataRoot in the
  config file. Now you can set dataRoot=mydirectory to make JBrowse load
  mydirectory instead of the default `data` by default
  ([issue #627](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/627),
  [issue #1144](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1144),
  [@cmdcolin](https://github.com/cmdcolin)).

- Added hashing of the BAM feature data to generate unique IDs in order to
  distinguish reads that have nearly identical information (same read name,
  start, end, seq, etc). If the reads literally have identical information in
  them JBrowse is still unable to display but this generally seems to be due to
  limited use case such as secondary alignments in RNA-seq
  ([issue #1108](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1108),
  [issue #1145](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1145),
  [@cmdcolin](https://github.com/cmdcolin))
