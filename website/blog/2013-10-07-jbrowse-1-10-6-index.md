## Minor improvements

*   Made the `impliedUTRs` option for ProcessedTranscript and Gene
glyph still attempt to create UTRs if only '''one''' of the UTRs is
missing from a transcript.  Thanks to Ben Booth for pointing out
the need for this.

## Bug fixes

*   Fixed bug in which the mouseover value displays for Wiggle and
SNPCoverage tracks would not always be hidden when the mouse leaves
the track.

*   Fixed a bad bug that prevented fixed-scale Wiggle and SNPCoverage
tracks from displaying.  Thanks to Jean-Jack Riethoven and Michael
Axtell for pointing this out.
