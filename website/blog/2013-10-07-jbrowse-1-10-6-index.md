## Minor improvements

- Made the `impliedUTRs` option for ProcessedTranscript and Gene glyph still
  attempt to create UTRs if only '''one''' of the UTRs is missing from a
  transcript. Thanks to Ben Booth for pointing out the need for this.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed bug in which the mouseover value displays for Wiggle and SNPCoverage
  tracks would not always be hidden when the mouse leaves the track.

- Fixed a bad bug that prevented fixed-scale Wiggle and SNPCoverage tracks from
  displaying. Thanks to Jean-Jack Riethoven and Michael Axtell for pointing this
  out.
