The lead developer on the JBrowse team is moving on to pastures new: Mitch Skinner has accepted an offer to work at an exciting new medical genomics startup (which will, for the moment, remain nameless, but keep an eye out for their launch sometime in the next year).

Mitch hopes to continue contributing to JBrowse, but this also leaves an open position in the core team. Accordingly, we are now hiring.

Full details of the position can be found at [http://biowiki.org/JBrowseJob](http://biowiki.org/JBrowseJob).

**Update: the position has been filled.  Many thanks to all the applicants!**
