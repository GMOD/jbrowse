We're excited to report that Robert Buels has joined the JBrowse team as lead
developer, effective January 10, 2012. He succeeds Mitch Skinner, who created
JBrowse in its modern form and more recently been working with the JBrowse
"sister project", [WebApollo](http://gmod.org/wiki/WebApollo).

Rob has been active in open-source bioinformatics for many years, contributing
to a long list of projects such as
[GBrowse](http://gmod.org/wiki/GBrowse 'Generic Genome Browser'),
[BioPerl](http://bioperl.org 'BioPerl'),
[Chado](http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado 'Chado'),
[Bio::Chado::Schema](http://metacpan.org/module/Bio::Chado::Schema 'Bio::Chado::Schema on metacpan'),
[Catalyst](http://www.catalystframework.org/), and
[DBIx::Class](http://metacpan.org/module/DBIx::Class). Before joining JBrowse,
Rob was employed as Engineering Lead at the
[Sol Genomics Network](http://solgenomics.net 'Sol Genomics Network'), a
clade-oriented database for plants centered on the Solanaceae family.

As JBrowse lead developer, Rob is responsible for the project's technical
strategy, architecture, planning, and coordination, as well as a large part of
the implementation. In the coming months, he intends to focus on helping JBrowse
mature as a project: solidifying its development infrastructure and
incorporating new features and contributions from developers around the world.
