A new tar.gz file is available, containing a copy of JBrowse 1.2.1  with Human hg19 data.  Being based on a more recent version of JBrowse, it should work much better than the previous hg19 tarball releases.  Enjoy!

The new file is here: [http://jbrowse.org/releases/jbrowse-1.2.1-hg19mini.tar.gz](http://jbrowse.org/releases/jbrowse-1.2.1-hg19mini.tar.gz)
