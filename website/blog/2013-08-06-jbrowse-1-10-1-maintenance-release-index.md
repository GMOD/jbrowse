Changes in this release:

-   Added support in `maker2jbrowse` for user-defined source tags in
    GFF3 output from MAKER. Thanks to Carson Holt for contributing
    this fix.

-   NCList data stores (actually the array representation used therein)
    now store feature attribute names case-insensitively.

-   Fixed a bug in which features in canvas-based feature tracks could
    not be clicked in Firefox. Thanks to GitHub user mke21 for
    pointing this out, and to Daniel Kasenberg for fixing my fix to
    work with older versions of Chrome.

-   Fixed a bug with client-side GFF3 parsing in which the strand of
    features was not being correctly parsed.

-   Fixed bug preventing backward-compatibility with 1.2.1-formatted
    data. Thanks to Daniel Kasenberg for implementing this.

-   Fixed a bug in the Gene glyph that caused the browser to crash if a
    gene feature has no subfeatures.
