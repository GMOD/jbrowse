Changes in this release:

*   Fixed bug with shift-rubberband-zooming not working on Windows
(issue #150) (Erik Derohanian).
*   Fixed "Can't locate JSON.pm" errors with add-track-json.pl.
*   Added a reference-sequence-selection dropdown box, similar to the
old one, that is shown by default if fewer than 30 reference
sequences, otherwise it's off unless `refSeqDropdown: true` is set
in the configuration (issue #138).
*   Fixed bug in which popup dialog boxes showing other websites showed
the website in only the top portion of the dialog box. Only
present in some browsers (issue #149).
*   Fix coordinate display bug in feature detail popups. The feature's
position was being displayed in interbase coordinates, but should
be displayed in 1-based coordinates. Thanks to Steffi Geisen for
pointing this out.
*   Added a `style.height` option to Wiggle tracks to control the
track's height in pixels (issue #131) (Erik Derohanian).
*   Added support for a `style.trackLabelCss` configuration variable to
allow customizing the appearance of the label for a particular
track (issue #4) (Erik Derohanian).
