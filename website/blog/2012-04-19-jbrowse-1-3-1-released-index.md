### **Changes in this release**

* Fixed memory-management bug that caused way too much RAM to be used
by FeatureTrack loading (flatfile, bam, and biodb-to-json.pl) when
loading with very large numbers of reference sequences. Big thanks
to Tristan Lubinski for help in isolating this.

* Fixed some bugs in BAM support section of setup.sh autosetup
script, thanks to Tristan Lubinski for help in isolating this as
well.

* Added an example document with an iframe running JBrowse in
embedded mode in docs/examples/embedded_mode.html

* flatfile-to-json.pl now loads the 'score' attribute of features in the
JSON.
