Changes in this release:

*   JBrowse now attempts to prevent feature labels being obscured by
track labels by keeping the feature labels a bit further away from
the left side of the view, if possible.
*   Fixed bug in which welcome page was not shown when JBrowse has not
been configured yet (issue #130).
*   Fixed bug in which passing `tracklist=0` (as when running the
browser in embedded mode) caused JBrowse to crash (issue #132).
*   Added dependency on Bio::GFF3::LowLevel::Parser 1.4, which has an
important bugfix related to multi-location features (issue #109).
