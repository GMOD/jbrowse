I am very pleased to announce the release of JBrowse version 1.16.0!

A major new feature of this release is the introduction of paired read
visualization options!

And rather than delivering just one type of paired read visualization, there are
many options for this including:

- Pileup - standard alignments view but with connections between pairs
- Read cloud - plotting by insert size
- Arc view - plotting paired reads as connected arcs

There are also multiple coloring options for each type of view, including
coloring by insert size (so abnormally large inserts are colored red for
example) or pair orientation. Here are some example screenshots to help
demonstrate

Figure 2. arc view which shows many long-range connections from a mate pair
dataset.

Figure 3. The read cloud view showing color by orientation and size (red being
abnormally large insert size, and turquoise and blue being incorrect pair
orientations)

JBrowse version 1.16.0 also contains many other features and bug fixes, so
please review the changelog below! Also make sure to view the
[paired read documentation](/docs/paired_reads.html) for more information on the
paired read options.

## Major improvements

- Added ability to view paired read data as connected entities for BAM and CRAM
  store classes. There are multiple different viewing options for this including
  plotting by insert size, plotting as connected arcs, or pileup views for the
  paired reads. Additonally multiple color schemes are available for coloring by
  insert size, pair orientation, mapping quality, and more. Thanks to

## Minor improvements

- For users with the "dev" or compiling JBrowse from source code, the ./setup.sh
  now performs a full webpack production build

  (<a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)

## Notable changes

- Rendering of features in popups, mouseover tooltips, and feature labels were
  made to escape HTML. If you are using literal HTML labels in these places then
  set the attribute `unsafePopup`, `unsafeMouseover`, or `unsafeHTMLFeatures` on
  your tracks. Thanks to
  <a href="https://github.com/garrettjstevens">@garrettjstevens</a>
