JBrowse 1.15.4 has been released! This release allows you to use bgzip indexed
FASTA, adds a new `categoryOrder` config for sorting the Hierarchical track
selector, and more! Thanks to everyone for their feature requests and bug
reports, and enjoy!

## Minor improvements

- Added support for bgzipped indexed FASTA. To use, bgzip your FASTA with
  `bgzip -i file.fa`, which generates file.fa.gz and file.fa.gzi and then use
  `samtools faidx file.fa.gz`. If you specify the .fa.gz in the track config
  e.g. `"urlTemplate": "file.fa.gz"` and have all three files in your data
  directory, then they will automatically be detected

- Allow fna and mfa file extensions for FASTA to be recognized by default in the
  Open sequence dialog
  (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1205">issue #1205</a>,

- Improve the layout slightly for dense features
  (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1210">issue #1210</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)

- Added a `topLevelFeaturesPercent` configuration variable that can be used to
  correct feature statistics estimates when `topLevelFeatures` is being used for
  a track, or when it contains deeply-nested features. This configuration
  variable is currently only used by BAM, BEDTabix, GFF3Tabix, and VCFTabix
  stores. (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1147">issue

- Tabix-based data stores use a new storage backend based on the `@gmod/tabix`
  npm module. Users should see some modest performance improvements for
  Tabix-based tracks.

  <a href="https://github.com/rbuels">@rbuels</a>)

- Added `hideSequenceBox` config to allow hiding the FASTA boxes in the View
  details popups. Thanks to
  <a href="https://github.com/andreamini">@andreamini</a> for reporting

  <a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)

- Added `categoryOrder` config to allow sorting the categories in the
  Hierarchical track selector. For example,
  `categoryOrder=VCF,Quantitative/Density,BAM`. Note that we specify a lowest
  level subcategory e.g. Quantitative/Density to sort the parent category
  Quantitative to a position

## Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug in which feature labels would sometimes be repeated across the
  view, in the wrong locations.
  (<a href="https://github.com/rbuels">@rbuels</a>)

- Fixed error where a chunk size limit error during histogram display would not
  be displayed (<a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)

- Fixed issue where Open sequence dialog will open up the default "data"
  directory instead of a blank instance
  (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1207">issue #1207</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)

- Added check for PCR duplicates for CRAM features
  (<a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)

- Fixed issue where editing the track names and types in the "Open track" dialog
  box was not working when editing multiple tracks
  (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1217">issue #1217</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)

- Fixed issue in which large VCF headers were not always correctly parsed by
  JBrowse (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1139">issue
  #1139</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1209">issue
  #1209</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rbuels">@rbuels</a>)

- Fixed issue where the histogram Y-scale bar would appear over features (issue
  #1214, <a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1218">issue #1218</a>,
