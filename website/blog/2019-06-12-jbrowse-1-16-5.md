I am pleased to announce the release of JBrowse 1.16.5. This includes some name
regularization fixes (e.g. when you have chr1 and 1 it tries to map to the same
thing), some bigwig fixes, a small speedup for BAM data, and more. Please read
the release notes!

## Minor improvements

- Added better error reporting if there is a BAI file for a genome that is
  longer than 2^29 and requires a CSI index

- Added default dontRedispatch=chromosome,region which avoids long GFF3Tabix
  redispatching for common gff3 types that don't need it.

- Added a `hideIframeDialogUrl` option to hide the iframe url in a
  `iframeDialog` popup. Thanks to
  <a href="https://github.com/mictadlo">@mictadlo</a> for the suggestion (issue
  #1365)

- Updated <a href="https://github.com/gmod">@gmod</a>/tabix and
  <a href="https://github.com/gmod">@gmod</a>/bam to unzip bgzf chunks as they
  are received instead of performing chunk merges. This also allows actual
  fileOffset to be used as a feature ID instead of CRC32 hash
  (<a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)

- Added regularization of chromosome names using roman numerals, common in both
  S. cerevisiae and C. elegans genome communities. Thanks to
  <a href="https://github.com/scottcain">@scottcain</a> for assistance
  (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1376">issue #1376</a>,

- Added ability for vertical scroll events to bubble out of the jbrowse div or
  iframe, which can be more intuitive in embedded jbrowse's. Otherwise, the
  GenomeView stopped all vertical scroll events in it's area. If you need the
  old behavior use `alwaysStopScrollBubble`.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed a long standing issue with BigWig files not accessing the lowest summary
  zoom level (e.g. the first one after unzoomed).

  <a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1359">issue #1359</a>)

- Fixed a bug with using the scoreType: maxScore configuration on Wiggle tracks
  failing at non-summary zoom levels. Thanks to
  <a href="https://github.com/patrickcng90">@patrickcng90</a> for reporting

- Fixed a bug with name regularizing that particularly affected CRAM on
  mitochondrial chromosomes. Thanks to
  <a href="https://github.com/sachalau">@sachalau</a> for patience and sample
  data for debugging this issue!
  (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1367">issue #1367</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)

- Fixed issue with GFF3/Tabix types colliding their attribute names with the
  field e.g. if start=0 was in column 9. Thanks to
  <a href="https://github.com/loraine-gueguen">@loraine-gueguen</a> for
  reporting (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1364">issue
  #1364</a>).

- Fixed an issue with NeatHTMLFeatures when zoomed out. Thanks to
  <a href="https://github.com/abretaud">@abretaud</a> for the implementation and
  fix (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1368">issue #1368</a>).

- Restored ability to access widest zoom level from bigwig. Thanks to
  <a href="https://github.com/lukaw3d">@lukaw3d</a> for noticing and debugging
  (<a href="https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1375">issue #1375</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)

- Fixed some minor parsing of 'b' type data series in CRAM files, which happens
  when CRAM is not using reference based compression so it is uncommon
  (<a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">@cmdcolin</a>)

- Added some more checks for track types for combination tracks (issue #1361)
