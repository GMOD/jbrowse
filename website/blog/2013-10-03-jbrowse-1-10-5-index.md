## Minor improvements

-   Greatly improved the speed and reduced the memory footprint when
    running `prepare-refseqs.pl` with the --fasta and --gff options.

-   Added an `impliedUTRs` option to the ProcessedTranscript and Gene
    glyphs for CanvasFeatures tracks. Thanks to Ben Booth for pointing
    out the need for this ([issue #348](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/348)).

-   Upgraded flatfile-to-json.pl to use a new version of
    Bio::GFF3::LowLevel::Parser for GFF3 parser, which has a lookback
    buffer limit that makes it easier to parse large GFF3 files that do
    not contain enough '###' directives.

-   Further improved the memory footprint and speed of
    generate-names.pl. Thanks to Richard Hayes for his continued help
    with testing improvements and reporting problems.

-   Removed explicit dependency on GD::Image, which is only used by the
    old tiled-image generation demo code. This will make dependency
    installation easier for many people, at a (very) small cost to
    backward compatibility.

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed a bad bug that prevented combination tracks from working.
    Thanks to Harry Yoo for pointing this out ([issue #351](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/351)).

-   Fixed a bug in which one of the temporary files used by
    generate-names.pl was not being created in the correct location.
    Thanks to Richard Hayes for testing this.

-   Fixed a bug in which `generate-names.pl` could sometimes crash when
    run with the -v (verbose) switch, or in setup.sh.

-   Fixed odd behavior when entering coordinate ranges in the location
    box under Safari. Thanks to Keiran Raine for pointing this out
    ([issue #341](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/341)).
