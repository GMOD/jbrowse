**We are happy to announce JBrowse 1.12.3 release! **

This release includes a lot of improvements and bugfixes and we thank the community for the support. Some great new features include parsers for new file formats including 2bit format, which can be loaded via prepare-refseqs.pl. There are also new parsers for tabix BED files, tabix GFF and IonTorrent BAM files. Some other improvements include a new `noFill` option to display BigWig tracks as a scatter plot, the `cacheMismatches` option that improves performance for BAM files with long reads, and many other small improvements and fixes.

In addition, visit the [JBrowse Plugin Registry](https://gmod.github.io/jbrowse-registry/) for a collection of great plugins.

Enjoy!

    updated to dojo 1.9.8 ([issue #718](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/718)).
-   Added the ability to load tabix indexed GFF and BED files.
    Thanks to Colin Diesh and @zhjilin for contributing ([issue #670](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/670)).
-   Added ability to open BED files in the "Open track" user interface
    ([issue #729](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/729)).
-   Added ability to access SPARQL and other jbrowse data stores via
    CORS. Thanks to the WebApollo hackathon and Eric Rasche for
    contributing ([issue #679](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/679)).

    track data" option, for example, adding exporter code in plugins
    ([issue #682](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/682)).
-   Added ability to specify custom name store classes via plugins,
    which allows plugins to implement their own search functionality
    ([issue #732](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/732)).
-   Added a timeout for the track feature density calculations which
    can aid problems like consistent chunkSizeLimit issues
    ([issue #540](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/540), [issue #730](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/730)).
-   Added an option to specify multiple highlights, or bookmarks,
    using the config file, a remote service, or the URL bar
    ([issue #668](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/668)).
-   Added support for parsing BAM files from IonTorrent ([issue #782](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/782),
    [issue #568](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/568)).
-   Added support for native file access to .2bit files ([issue #759](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/759)).
-   Added list of plugins in about box ([issue #848](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/848)).
-   Added cacheMismatches option to improve performance when viewing
    long-read alignments ([issue #860](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/860)).
-   Added subfeatureDetailLevel config item to make View details box
    only load subfeatures on demand ([issue #861](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/861)).
-   Added ability to draw scatter plot from BigWig tracks. Thanks to
    Keiran Raine for the contribution ([issue #741](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/741)).
-   Added a fullviewlink option for the URL bar to disable "View full
    link" attribute in embedded JBrowse. Thanks to Vivek Krishnakumar
    for contributing ([issue #813](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/813)).
-   Added URL parameter &tracklabels=0 and config parameter to hide
    track labels ([issue #869](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/869)).
-   Added renderAlignment option which creates a per-base alignment
    view of the read versus the reference ([issue #795](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/795)).
-   Added inferCdsParts option which creates CDS subfeatures from a
    continuous CDS region for CanvasFeatures glyphs. Thanks to
    Vivek Krishnakumar for the contribution ([issue #872](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/872)).
-   Added events tracks/focus, tracks/unfocus, allowing for context
    switching based on selected track.
