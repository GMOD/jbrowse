**We are happy to announce JBrowse 1.12.3 release! **

This release includes a lot of improvements and bugfixes and we thank the
community for the support. Some great new features include parsers for new file
formats including 2bit format, which can be loaded via prepare-refseqs.pl. There
are also new parsers for tabix BED files, tabix GFF and IonTorrent BAM files.
Some other improvements include a new `noFill` option to display BigWig tracks
as a scatter plot, the `cacheMismatches` option that improves performance for
BAM files with long reads, and many other small improvements and fixes.

In addition, visit the
[JBrowse Plugin Registry](https://gmod.github.io/jbrowse-registry/) for a
collection of great plugins.

Enjoy!

  Diesh and @zhjilin for contributing
  ([issue #670](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/670)).

  plugins to implement their own search functionality
  ([issue #732](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/732)).

  problems like consistent chunkSizeLimit issues

  attribute in embedded JBrowse. Thanks to Vivek Krishnakumar for contributing

- Added URL parameter &tracklabels=0 and config parameter to hide track labels
  ([issue #869](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/869)).
- Added renderAlignment option which creates a per-base alignment view of the
  read versus the reference
  ([issue #795](https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/795)).
