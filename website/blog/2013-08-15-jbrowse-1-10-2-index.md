  release:

- Added mouse-over 'tooltips' to to CanvasFeatures tracks that show the a
  feature's label and description when the mouse hovers over it. Thanks to
  Daniel Kasenberg for implementing this.
- Strand arrowheads in CanvasFeatures tracks now attempt to stay visible on the
  screen, like they do in HTMLFeatures tracks. Thanks to Daniel Kasenberg for
  implementing this.
- Fixed bugs and inefficiencies preventing JBrowse from handling very dense
  BigWig files. Thanks to Michael Axtell for pointing this out (issue #312).
- Fixed a bug in which features were not always laid out correctly in
  CanvasFeature tracks when the display mode is set to "compact".
- Fixed a bug causing the text labels of mismatching bases in Alignments2 tracks
  (i.e. `Alignments` canvas glyphs) to be slightly misaligned vertically when
  feature labels are turned on (they are off by default for Alignments glyphs).
- Fixed a bug preventing the `defaultTracks` configuration variable from
  operating correctly.
