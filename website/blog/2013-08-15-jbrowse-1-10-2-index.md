Changes in this release:

*   Added mouse-over 'tooltips' to to CanvasFeatures tracks that show
the a feature's label and description when the mouse hovers over
it. Thanks to Daniel Kasenberg for implementing this.
*   Strand arrowheads in CanvasFeatures tracks now attempt to stay
visible on the screen, like they do in HTMLFeatures tracks. Thanks
to Daniel Kasenberg for implementing this.
*   Fixed bugs and inefficiencies preventing JBrowse from handling very
dense BigWig files. Thanks to Michael Axtell for pointing this out
(issue #312).
*   Fixed a bug in which features were not always laid out correctly in
CanvasFeature tracks when the display mode is set to "compact".
*   Fixed a bug causing the text labels of mismatching bases in
Alignments2 tracks (i.e. `Alignments` canvas glyphs) to be slightly
misaligned vertically when feature labels are turned on (they are
off by default for Alignments glyphs).
*   Fixed a bug preventing the `defaultTracks` configuration variable
from operating correctly.
