I'm pleased to announce the release of JBrowse 1.6.5, containing some small new features, plus fixes for some issues in the [1.6.4 release](https://jbrowse.org/jbrowse-1-6-4-bugfix-release/ "JBrowse 1.6.4 bugfix is also coming along very soon, with a (we hope!) very impressive set of new features.  Stay tuned.release").

Files for download:

-   [JBrowse-1.6.5-min.zip](https://jbrowse.org/releases/JBrowse-1.6.5-min.zip) - 2.8M
-   [JBrowse-1.6.5-full.zip](https://jbrowse.org/releases/JBrowse-1.6.5-full.zip) - 27.3M
    Changes in this release:

-   The location box now shows the **length of the currently visible**
    ** region** in parentheses. For example: `ctgB:1244..3566 (2.32 Kb)`.
    Thanks to Karsten Hokamp for the suggestion!
-   The **arrow keys** on the keyboard can now be used to pan and scroll
    around the genome view.
-   Wiggle track mouseover cursors now display the score with only 6
    significant digits, avoiding confusion over approximations
    introduced by scores being converted to IEEE floating-point numbers
    (as for BigWig files) and back to text.
-   The faceted track selector now renders any HTML that may be present
    in the track metadata by default. To turn this off, it now accepts
    an `escapeHTMLInData` option that, if set to `true` or `1`, will
    not render the HTML, but will instead display the raw code
    (issue #145).
-   Upgraded to a more recent version of jszlib, which contains some
    important bugfixes (issue #157).
-   Fixed bug dealing with very large regions with the same value in
    canvas-based Wiggle tracks (also issue #157).
-   `prepare-refseqs.pl` now by default uses a **more scalable directory**
    ** structure for storing sequences**. This fixes problems some users
    were experiencing with large numbers of reference sequences
    (issue #139).
-   `ucsc-to-json.pl` now supports a `--primaryName` option allowing
    the users to **alter which UCSC data field is displayed by JBrowse as**
    ** the primary name** of the features in a track. Also,
    `ucsc-to-json.pl` now treats as indexable names all UCSC data
    columns called "name", "alias", or "id" followed by zero or more
    digits. Thanks to Steffi Geisen for this suggestion.
-   Fixed "Duplicate specification" warnings coming from
    `flatfile-to-json.pl` and `remove-track.pl`.
-   Fixed bugs in which both the first few and the last few bases of a
    reference sequence were not displaying correctly in a DNA track.
