I'm pleased to announce the release of JBrowse 1.16.1! This release offers a
variety of small bugfixes for cross-origin resource fetching, BAM files, and
JBrowse desktop.

It also contains a fix that helps very large track lists to have a faster
initial load for the Hierarchical track selector specifically.

Enjoy browsing!
