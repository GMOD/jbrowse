### Development Roadmap

The course of JBrowse development is set by the GitHub issues and the release milestones they are assigned to.  The [GitHub development milestones](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse/milestones "JBrowse Development Milestones") page is a good start for exploring what new features are planned for each release.

### Coordination

Lead developer Rob Buels, and often others, hang out in the `#gmod` IRC channel on the freenode IRC network. For directions on connecting to Freenode, see [http://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml](http://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml).  The [gmod-ajax](http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/gmod-ajax) mailing list (managed at SourceForge) is a good place to talk about development, as well.
