JBrowse 1.9.7 has been released, with an important fix for a race condition that intermittently causes some NCList-based tracks to show the wrong genomic region when the browser is first started, and a fix for a bug in how JBrowse plugin paths are calculated.

    Changes in this release:

-   Fixed a bug in which the initial viewing location (passed from a
    URL parameter or similar) is not always set correctly in NCList-based tracks. Thanks to Steffi Geisen for pointing this out.

-   Fixed a bug in which JavaScript paths for plugins were incorrectly
    calculated when a `baseUrl` global configuration variable was set.
    Thanks to Matt Bomhoff for pointing this out.
