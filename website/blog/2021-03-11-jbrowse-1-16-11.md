Hi all,

This is a small maintanence release that fixes an issue that was seen with very
long CRAM reads and an issue that was seen with some users installing with
setup.sh producing an error. Thanks to everyone for their bug reports and
requests and for being patient with jbrowse 1 releases as we speed ahead with
jbrowse 2!
