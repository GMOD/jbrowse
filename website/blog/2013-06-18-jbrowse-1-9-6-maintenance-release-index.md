Changes in this release:

*   Fixed a bug in which the reference sequence selection dropdown menu
did not work for purely numeric reference sequence names.  Thanks
to Matt Bomhoff for pointing this out.

*   Fixed a bug with some types of BAM files in which not all BAM
features would be displayed.  Thanks to Ignazio Carbone for
pointing this out. (issue #276).

*   Fixed bug in which File->Open failed to open GFF3 files with
embedded sequences in a FASTA section.

*   Added a `--workdir` option to `generate-names.pl` to allow name
index building on a faster filesystem than the one that will
ultimately store the name index.  Thanks to Alexie Papanicolaou for
suggesting this. (issue #273).
